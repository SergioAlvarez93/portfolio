В этом году опрос стартует ранее чем в прошлом, что, надеемся, позволит увеличить его количество участников.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ключевые моменты:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Опрос показывает более широкое использование блоков и нового редактора сайта (по сравнению с классическим редактором), что не должно вызывать удивления, поскольку тема по умолчанию теперь является темой на блоках</li>\n\n\n\n<li>22% респондентов использовали WordPress всего год или меньше. Те, кто участвует в опросе, также становятся немного старше: меньше ответов от тех, кто моложе 40 лет, чем в предыдущие годы.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Каждый пятый респондент узнал о WordPress от коллеги и примерно такой же процент благодаря поисковой системе.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>В 2022 году пользователи WordPress продолжали изучать WordPress (68%), обучали других WP (48%) и создавали сайты для других (55%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Пользователи WordPress выбирают платформу, потому что она с открытым исходным кодом (62%), гибкая (47%), с низким уровнем риска (45%), экономичная (45%) и имеет положительную репутацию (41%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57% участников опроса получали новости и обучение непосредственно на WordPress.org. Хотя это основной источник, другие сайты остаются очень важными: поисковые системы (46%), YouTube (40%), другие сообщества WordPress (35%) и социальные сети (30%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Подавляющее большинство респондентов не используют регулярно другие платформы CMS, а 21% респондентов не используют ни один из 20 наиболее популярных плагинов WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Респонденты продолжают утверждать, что «WordPress не хуже других платформ CMS или даже лучше», с этим согласны 68%. Элементы, которые респонденты считают лучшими аспектами WordPress, включают «простоту использования», «гибкость» и/или «варианты плагинов» — примерно по 30% каждый. Говоря о наиболее разочаровывающих элементах WordPress, каждый пятый ответил: «Ничего», а примерно 30% упомянули трудности с редактированием сайта / Гутенберг.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Общий опыт участников остается положительным. 64% поделились положительным опытом, а 24% оценили свой опыт как «нейтральный». Авторы также чувствуют себя желанными гостями с таким же процентом (64% согласны и 24% нейтральны).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Более подробно ознакомиться с результатами можно скачав <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/2022-Annual-Survey-Final.pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/2022-Annual-Survey-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">этот файл PDF</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Опрос этого года</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Чтобы ваш опыт работы с WordPress был представлен в результатах опроса 2023 года, примите участие в опросе прямо сейчас</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-2 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7439442/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey\" style=\"background-color:#0072b9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Пройти опрос</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Вы также можете пройти опрос на других языках, воспользовавшись ссылкой выше и переключившись на другой язык, благодаря усилиям полиглотов WordPress. Опрос будет открыт в течение пяти недель. Результаты будут опубликованы в блоге WordPress News в начале декабря.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>В этом году, как и в прошлом, в опрос были внесены некоторые улучшения в структуру и набор вопросов. Также тестируется новая платформа, предлагающая обновленный интерфейс, расширенную многоязычную поддержку, расширенные инструменты анализа и визуализации результатов и многое другое. Новая платформа также имеет встроенные средства контроля доступа и конфиденциальности, что гарантирует, что опрос будет отвечать разнообразным потребностям сообщества WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Пожалуйста, <strong>помогите распространить информацию об опросе</strong>, поделившись им в своей сети, через Slack или через записи в социальных сетях.

На 2022 год опрос получил комплексное обновление, первое за шесть лет. Общее количество вопросов было сокращено с почти 100 до 29, в основном удалены социально-экономические вопросы и введена шкала Лайкерта. Эти обновления были предназначены для увеличения скорости заполнения опроса, обеспечения более эффективного и структурированного анализа этих данных и позиционирования опроса для наилучшего определения тем, которые наиболее важны для сообщества WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Цель состоит в том, чтобы информация, полученная в ходе опроса, помогла информировать об инициативах и направлениях работы WordPress в ближайшем будущем, наряду с другими сигналами, такими как обсуждения в сообществе, блоги <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org\">Making WordPress</a> и мероприятия.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Основные моменты</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>В выпуске опроса 2022 года процент завершения увеличился на 26%, однако количество представленных материалов уменьшилось на 56% до примерно 3400, включая около 800 участников. Для опроса 2023 года реклама будет увеличена, что, мы надеемся, компенсирует снижение числа заявок. Доля анкет заполненных на русском языке составила 7% (237 участников). Мы очень надеемся увидеть больше в опросе за 2023 год!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Опрос показывает более широкое использование блоков и нового редактора сайта (по сравнению с классическим редактором), что не должно вызывать удивления, поскольку тема по умолчанию теперь основана на блоках.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>22% респондентов используют WordPress только год или меньше. Те, кто отвечает на опрос, также становятся немного старше: меньше ответов от лиц моложе 40 лет, чем в предыдущие годы.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 из 5 респондентов узнал о WordPress от коллеги и примерно такой же процент от использования поисковой системы.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>В 2022 году пользователи WordPress продолжали изучать WordPress (68%), обучали других работе с WP (48%) и создавали сайты для других (55%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Пользователи выбирают платформу CMS, потому что она с открытым исходным кодом (62%), гибкая (47%), с низким уровнем риска (45%), рентабельна (45%) и имеет положительную репутацию (41%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>57% участников опроса получали новости и обучающие материалы непосредственно с WordPress.org. Хотя это основной источник, другие сайты остаются очень важными: поисковые системы (46%), YouTube (40%), другие сообщества WordPress (35%) и социальные сети (30%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Подавляющее большинство респондентов не используют другие платформы CMS, а 21% респондентов не используют ни один из 20 лучших плагинов WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Респонденты продолжают заявлять, что «WordPress не хуже или даже лучше других платформ CMS», с чем согласны 68%. Элементы, которые респонденты считают лучшими аспектами WordPress, включают «простоту использования», «гибкость» и/или «варианты плагинов», всего около 30% каждого. На вопрос о наиболее разочаровывающих элементах WordPress 1 из 5 ответил «ничего», а примерно 30% сослались на трудности с редактированием сайта или редактором блоков.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Общий опыт участников остается положительным, 64% поделились своим положительным опытом, а 24% оценили свой опыт как «нейтральный». </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Участники сообщества также чувствуют себя желанными как и ранее (64% согласны и 24% нейтральны).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Планы на 2023</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>В следующей итерации опроса планируется улучшить языковые возможности, а также продолжить уточнение вопросов вариантов ответов. Важно помнить, что заполнение опроса требует времени, поэтому мы хотим убедиться, что членам сообщества задаются вопросы, которые больше всего помогают WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Предварительный план состоит в том, чтобы запустить опрос 2023 года уже в августе. Это создаст возможность собрать больше результатов и, что наиболее важно, их учета в планировании ключевых инициатив и направлений деятельности на 2024 год. Отзывы сообщества жизненно важны для успеха и направления проекта. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-4 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-50\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-charcoal-0-color has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/2022-Annual-Survey-Final.pdf\">Скачать PDF-файл с результатами опроса</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Для подготовки публикации использованы материалы:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/episode-55-happy-anniversary-wordpress/\">Episode 55: Happy Anniversary, WordPress!</a><br><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/2022-annual-survey-results-next-steps/\">2022 Annual Survey Results &amp; Next Steps</a><br></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"2579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Люди WordPress: Хаува Абашия\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://ru.wordpress.org/news/2023/03/people-of-wordpress-hauwa-abashiya/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 12:56:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Люди WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"people-of-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://ru.wordpress.org/?p=2569\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:650:\"В этой статье мы рассказываем о Хауве Абашия, менеджере проектов в Нигерии и Великобритании, чье стремление помогать людям и ее профессиональные навыки нашли применение и признание в глобальном сообществе WordPress.

Чтобы бы это ни было, оно может помочь нам выйти за рамки повседневной рутины и переосмыслить то, что мы знаем. Именно это случилось с Хаувой, она почувствовала, что нашла свое место и смогла по новому посмотреть на свою жизнь и планы. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Для нее поворотной точкой стало открытие WordPress, проекта с открытым исходным кодом.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Обучение разработке и WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>В 2017 году Хаува, уже опытный и успешный менеджер проектов, осознала, что не испытывает от работы того же восторга, как раньше, и ей откровенно скучно. «Я знала, что мне по-прежнему нравится работать с проектами и заниматься их управлением, но мне нужно было что-то менять», — вспоминает она.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тогда Хаува записалась на курсы веб-разработки, где освоила HTML, CSS и немного JavaScript. Одной из возможностей курса было изучение WordPress, и она выбрала его. Преподаватель курса посоветовал ей посетить конференцию WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува посчитала, что необходимо иметь базовые знания о CMS (системе управления контентом сайта) до того, как приедет на мероприятие, и углубилась в самостоятельное изучение WordPress. Первый WordCamp, который она посетила, проходил в приморском городе Брайтон на южном побережье Англии. Там она встретила людей, которые стали ее друзьями и наставниками на долгие годы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>«Меня вдохновили встречи с людьми из сообщества WordPress. Моя жизнь и мое желание поддерживать сообщества изменились к лучшему благодаря людям, которых я встретила, и я продолжаю благодарна судьбе за знакомство с ними».</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Глобальное сообщество WordPress: от Германии до Нигерии</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Открыв для себя сообщество WordPress в Великобритании, Хаува заинтересовалась его реальными масштабами, и услышав, что WordCamp Europe — флагманское мероприятие, собирающее тысячи людей со всего мира, захотела принять участие в его организации и использовать свои навыки управления проектами. Она подала заявку и стала волонтером в трехдневной конференции, которая в 2019 году проходила в столице Германии, Берлине. На этом мероприятии Хаува познакомилась не только с участниками со всего мира, но и открыла для себя активное сообщество WordPress в своей родной Нигерии. После она обнаружила как легко поддерживать связь с друзьями со всего мира через мессенджеры.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вдохновившись людьми, которые использовали WordPress для улучшения жизни людей в Нигерии и других частях Африки, Хаува начала изучать, как WordPress и его глобальное сообщество могут помочь улучшить взаимопонимание между культурами и континентами.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/02/hauwa-and-her-mom.jpg\" alt=\"Хаува и ее мать Розалинд на одном из мероприятий в Нигерии.\" title=\"Хаува и ее мать Розалинд на одном из мероприятий в Нигерии\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Отец Хаувы, доктор Ауду Квасау Абашия, и ее мать Розалинд Зулай Абашия — известны своей благотворительной деятельностью, в частности оказанием поддержки людям в Кадуне, на севере Нигерии, и Абудже в центре страны. Хаува поясняет: «Моя мама происходит из семьи, которая делится своими навыками для оказания практической помощи. От друзей, с которыми я познакомилась в WordPress, я узнала, что есть части общества, которые придерживаются такой же этики. Я могла бы стать частью этого, внести свою лепту в развитие Нигерии в будущем».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ее родители основали благотворительный фонд, цель которого — помощь вдовам, сиротам и детям получить доступ к образованию, от финансов до музыки. Он связывает тех, кто нуждается в помощи, и тех, кто может оказать поддержку.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува говорит: «Обучение людей практическим навыкам, которые можно использовать для получения дохода или которыми можно поделиться с семьей и другими людьми в своем районе, очень важно. Подобные проекты помогают развивать и поддерживать общину. Такие навыки, как шитье и кулинария — это не просто возможность одеться и поставить еду на стол, но и обретение независимости и гордости. Они являются примером того, как микроэкономика может развиваться и вдохновлять людей на мечты, воплощающиеся в жизнь. В ходе своей работы и учебы я убедилась, что технологии, используемые сознательно и с пониманием решаемых задач, способны изменить жизнь общин к лучшему. Такие проекты, как WordPress, могут стать частью этой движущей силы благодаря переводу на родной язык и самому программному обеспечению, позволяющему делиться идеями».</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/02/hauwa-in-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Хаува в Нигерии\" title=\"Хаува в Нигерии\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Имея опыт управления проектами и работы в сфере информационных технологий, Хаува все больше интересуется тем, как можно использовать свои навыки не только для сплочения сообщества, но и для практического долгосрочного вклада в местную инфраструктуру и внедрения быстро меняющихся технологий.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Она говорит: «Я бы хотела, чтобы некоторые люди, которым помог фонд, основанный моими родителями, могли поделиться своими идеями и достижениями и вдохновлять других. Одним из путей может стать программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом, доступное для использования и которое может работать на мобильных телефонах».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>«Побыв представителем <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training Team</a> (команды обучения), я на собственном опыте убедилась, насколько важно, чтобы пользователи не являющиеся технарями могли использовать программное обеспечение для обмена своими идеями без необходимости становиться разработчиками. Мы все можем помочь людям быть услышанными, и если мы работаем в сфере технологий, мы играем определенную роль в создании и продвижении доступности инструментов для этого».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В списке желаний Хаувы помочь африканским странам получить доступ к программному обеспечению и технологиям на их местных языках. Она говорит: «Это часть самобытности, уважения и признания различных культур, а не ожидание того, что все будет переведено с английского дословно. Это дает возможность пожилым людям пользоваться программным обеспечением или опубликованным контентом».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува выучила хауса (язык, на котором говорят в нескольких африканских странах) и английский одновременно у себя дома в Нигерии. Она, как и ее родители, получила образование в разных местах, училась и работала в разных странах. В 16 лет Хаува занялась информатикой как развлечением, не догадываясь, что в будущем это станет важной частью ее трудовой жизни. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/02/hauwa-in-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Хаува в кафе в 2015 году\" title=\"Хаува в кафе в 2015 году\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Она собиралась поступить в университет, чтобы изучать финансы и социологию. Когда она пошла прощаться с классом по информатике, учитель спросил, что она собирается делать. Услышав о ее планах, учитель сказал: «Ты не хочешь заниматься этим, ты хочешь заниматься чем-то в области IT». Этот разговор стал поворотным моментом для Хаувы. Она продолжила изучать вычислительные и информационные системы и объектно-ориентированные информационные системы для получения степени магистра в Великобритании.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На втором курсе университета она также работала с технологиями вводом данных и в смежных областях, поскольку была полна решимости узнать как можно больше о различных направлениях. После окончания магистратуры она выбрала работу, которая позволяла ей работать с системами, их поддержкой, управлением проектами, цепочками поставок и закупками. Она является сторонником изучения как можно большего количества смежных дисциплин, чтобы получить широкий набор инструментов для реального понимания того, что нужно клиентам и как помочь им достичь подходящих и своевременных решений. Эти навыки оказались полезными и в последующие годы, что позволило ей найти время для поддержки конференций WordCamp, митапов и Training Team. Она говорит: «Участники проектов с открытым исходным кодом являются представителями самых разных профессиональных и культурных слоев. Участие в проекте — это отличный способ делиться своими навыками и сохранять их актуальным и быть открытым для новых возможностей обучения».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува сохранила любовь к управлению проектами и образованию, она получила квалификации в этой области, включая Prince 2 и PMP. Она остается верна идее непрерывного обучения в своей сегодняшней работе с Agile и другими методологиями и находит взаимосвязь между работой и своим стремлением к просвещению.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/02/hauwa-at-wc-london-2019-2.jpg\" alt=\"Хаува у стойки регистрации на WordCamp London 2019\" title=\"Хаува у стойки регистрации на WordCamp London 2019\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Стремясь поддержать и местное сообщество в Великобритании, Хаува присоединилась к London WordPress Meetup, а в 2019 году стала организатором WordCamp London, где она использовала свой опыт в области управления проектами. Во время этих мероприятий она провела множество бесед, призывая других развивать свои навыки в области ИТ и делясь собственным опытом.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Этот интерес к повышению уровня квалификации других людей естественным образом привел ее к дальнейшему участию в работе команд <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress</a>. Вдохновленная идеей поделиться своими навыками другим участником проекта, она присоединилась к <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training Team</a> на Contributor Day во время WordCamp. Эта команда трудится над созданием онлайн платформы — <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn</a>, позволяющей людям осваивать программное обеспечение и поддерживать свои знания актуальными, а также научиться развивать сообщество в своем регионе. Хаува считает, что доступность — ключевой фактор, поэтому она посвятила много времени проработке документации для лучшего понимания. Она считает, что это необходимо для того, чтобы действительно предоставить людям доступную информацию и определить, где требуется дополнительная работа. Ее вера в это только укрепилась, когда она присоединилась к <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/\">Accessibility Team</a> (команде по обеспечению доступности) релиза WordPress 5.6, и она внесла свой вклад в документацию и образовательные материалы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува посвятила много часов поддержке Training Team в течение нескольких лет, будучи убежденной в том, что правильные ресурсы могут действительно помочь сообществам во всем мире использовать программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом. Она также подчеркивает важность того, чтобы материалы должны быть удобными для пользователей и легко переводиться, поскольку проект WordPress имеет глобальный масштаб.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Вклад в программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом заряжает энергией</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Благодаря сочетанию волонтерской деятельности в Великобритании и Нигерии, а также поддержке участников по всему миру, Хаува заново открыла в себе стремление помогать людям — планировать и достигать своих целей. Она смогла поделиться своим 15-летним опытом управления проектами в своей волонтерской деятельности и призывает других рассмотреть эту профессию в качестве карьеры.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/02/Hauwa-WC-Europe-2019.jpg\" alt=\"Хаува на WordCamp Europe 2019\" title=\"Хаува на WordCamp Europe 2019\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>«Занимаясь волонтерством, вы работаете рядом с людьми. Управление проектами связано с людьми. Это помощь людям в достижении целей. То же самое можно сделать и через волонтерство, и вы можете многому научиться, встречаясь с людьми из разных мест». </p>\n\n\n\n<p>«Одним из моих стимулов является использование технологий для решения проблем. Для меня, как руководителя проектов, большая честь помогать людям и организациям определять и достигать цели. Это позволяет им обрести ценность. Это одна из причин, по которой меня потянуло к поиску технологических сообществ и участию в них. Если это то, что движет вами, читающими о моем опыте, то у вас есть широкие возможности поделиться своими навыками. Найдите то, что подходит именно вам, там, где вы сейчас находитесь». </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Хаува призывает всех, кто работает в сфере технологий, углубить свое понимание управления проектами и работы с различными командами. «Навыки управления проектами очень важны, в каком бы проекте вы ни работали. Из-за долгих рабочих часов на протяжении многих лет я чувствовала, что потеряла связь с людьми. Я застряла в, казалось, повторяющемся цикле. Благодаря людям, которых я встретила в сообществе WordPress, и использованию моих профессиональных навыков, я вспомнила о своих собственных ценностях и о том, как в качестве менеджера проектов я могу помочь другим достичь новых высот или сделать что-то ценное и существенное, чем другие могут использовать».  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>В 2022 году Хаува вернулась к работе на полную ставку в национальных и международных проектах впечатляющих своими масштабами и время ее волонтерской работы в рамках глобальных инициатив по развитию сообществ сократилось, но она продолжает вносить свой вклад в WordPress, сосредоточившись на продвижении образовательных проектов и культурной стороне сообщества.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>«Я буду продолжать интересоваться тем, как проекты с открытым исходом, такие как WordPress, работая вместе с другими решениями, может помочь некоммерческим организациям в их развитии. По мне, если существуют технологические решения, то мы все можем сыграть определенную роль в их развитии и изменении ситуации».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>«То, как мы помогаем сообществам, не обязательно должно оставаться неизменным на протяжении всего времени. Важно постоянно смотреть на то, что необходимо, и на то, какую пользу это может принести».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>«Найдите то, что хотела ли бы воплотить для своего родного соообщества, и, возможно, существуют технологии, которые могут воплотить его. Я рада, что начала свое путешествие».</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Поделитесь историями</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Познакомьтесь с другими историями в серии «Люди WordPress», помогите поделиться или с другими и присоединяйтесь к нам, чтобы найти новое применение собственным знаниям и талантам, найти друзей и внести вклад в развитие проекта в глобальном масштабе.

Как удается все совмещать и не разбрасываться, что тебя вдохновляет и чему научился за это время?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Начнем с того, что мой общий стаж в разработке почти 19 лет, за которые я перепробовал все методики управления своим временем и проектами. Плюс после переезда из мегаполиса в деревню я стал работать удаленно задолго до того, как это стало мейнстримом. По этим причинам я выработал для себя определенный график труда и отдыха.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Во-первых, никакой работы по выходным, праздникам и в отпуске — мозги нужно постоянно разгружать, иначе очень просто выгореть, когда ведешь несколько проектов одновременно и держишь огромные массивы данных в голове, постоянно что-то просчитываешь, прикидываешь, прорабатываешь разные варианты.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Во-вторых, на протяжении дня обязательны перерывы, во время которых никаких гаджетов и телевизоров быть не должно — глазам тоже нужен отдых. В это время лучше выйти на улицу, пройтись, поглядеть вдаль и помечтать о будущем ) Тут может помочь любой pomodoro таймер.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В третьих, необходимо соблюдать режим дня (который у меня последнее время немного сбился). Исторически сложилось, что мой рабочий день вот уже много лет начинается в 11 и заканчивается в 19 часов по московскому времени. В Москве это самые удобные часы, чтобы добраться до работы и безболезненно уехать домой, а утром всегда есть время на семью: походы по магазинам или поездка в поликлинику с ребенком.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Свой блог я начал вести еще когда учился в университете на радиотехника в Туле, он задумывался именно как дневник/записная книжка для себя и одногруппников, где я делился своими открытиями в чудесном мире разработки на РНР, верстки под IE6, Netscape 4 и Opera 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я очень много поглощаю информации из интернета за день (в основном через RSS как старый добрый олдфаг), особо интересные заметки кладу в закладки для чтения позже. И есть огромное желание делиться этими знаниями с людьми (я помню то время, когда не было интернета и всю информацию мы получали из книг, журналов и энциклопедий), поэтому с появлением Твиттера я стал постить много контента туда, так как&nbsp;под содержимое моего блога.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Со временем русскоязычный Твиттер стал превращаться в помойку и одновременно с этим появился Телеграм, в котором я был одним из первых бета-тестеров. Мы стали переводить рабочие чаты туда, создавать каналы для своих, так появились сначала закрытые, а потом уже и открытые публично чаты и каналы: WordPress Digest (сюда мы постим новости по WordPress), WordPress Jobs (работа вокруг WordPress), Elementor (чат по конструктору страниц Elementor) и многие другие. Основные можно поглядеть у меня <a href=\"https://www.kobzarev.com/wordpress/wordpress-resources/\">в блоге</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вдохновляет меня на все эти подвиги моя семья и мои родители, я им искренне благодарен за знания, которые они в меня вложили в детстве и научили самостоятельности, благодаря которой я много лет занимаюсь самообразованием и стараюсь помогать другим. А вот опыт больших компаний (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla) меня не вдохновляет, так как они всего лишь попали в нужное место в нужное время. Каждый должен наступить на свои грабли, ведь человек не учится на чужих ошибках.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Почему WordPress? Всегда ли сложный проект значит «интересный» для тебя как разработчика?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>За эти 19 лет я набрался огромного опыта почти во всех сферах необъятного веба: фронтенд, бэкенд, seo и даже дизайн, перепробовал кучу языков программирования, прошел десятки курсов и прочитал сотни книг, поработал в нескольких крупных компаниях и мелких веб-студий и могу сказать однозначно: WordPress — сила.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>К WordPress я пришел не сразу. Это был долгий тернистый путь. Все начиналось с написания своей CMS в компании Ingate (которая была блочная как текущий Gutenberg и использовала ныне непопулярный XML/XSLT).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Потом была своя CMS в студии Imagos на чистом РНР4 без фреймворков, которую можно до сих пор встретить на некоторых сайтах.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>А после переезда из Тулы в Москву я попал в информационное агентство, где мы делали сайты для МИД, дипломатов, РАН, поднимали свои информационные, новостные порталы, здесь мне пригодился опыт написания своих CMS под нужды заказчиков и мы с коллегами запилили не просто новую CMS, а целую платформу, на которой сейчас крутится около 12к сайтов для сельских газет, они им достались совершенно бесплатно.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>И тут случился кризис в стране и нам пришлось всем временно уйти на удаленку, так как ЗП платить нам перестали, а на дорогу и покушать в Москве нужно было много денег, плюс съемная квартира и маленький ребенок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В это время, чтобы прокормить семью, пришлось работать с разными CMS (Joomla, Drupal, ModX) и фреймворками (Zend, Symfony, Laravel, Yii).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Компания не смогла быстро выйти из этого кризиса и мы с бывшими коллегами покинули занимаемые должности и запустили несколько стартапов разной направленности, которые мы сделали на популярном тогда Битрикс.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Работая с Битрикс, я испытал много боли и унижения. В итоге мы уперлись в потолок его кастомизации и решили попробовать WordPress, у меня был небольшой опыт работы с ним в то время. Максимум, что я тогда сделал — развернул свой блог на нем и перенес туда все свои заметки за много лет. Так начался мой путь в WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Следующие несколько лет с каждым днем проектов на WordPress мне попадалось все больше и больше, как простых так и сложных, копился опыт и я начал писать свои <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mihdan/#content-plugins\">бесплатные плагины под WordPress</a>, которые я по сей день дополняю и поддерживаю, новый функционал добавляется за счет донов и отдается бесплатно.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>И вот уже 10 лет я делаю сайты на WordPress, разрабатываю бэкенд для мобильных приложений на WordPress REST API или использую «безголовый» (headless) WordPress для сайтов на React/Vue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Это не всегда интересные проекты, но всегда достаточно сложные, высоконагруженные и объемные с большим количеством кастомного кода на бэкенде. Я стараюсь не брать (но в качестве исключения иногда беру) совсем простые проекты и не заниматься доработками чужих, предпочитаю стартапы — там всегда можно найти для себя что-то интересное и ограничивает тебя лишь полет фантазии ))</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Ты родом из маленького села в Магаданской области и сейчас предпочитаешь сельскую местность мегаполисам. Давно ли ты работаешь удаленно, легко ли это и почему выбрал жизнь вне города?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Родился я в поселке Сеймчан («Солнечная долина» по-эвенски) Магаданской области, после окончания школы поступил в ТулГУ в городе Тула на радиотехника и мечтал ремонтировать телевизоры и видеомагнитофоны, но судьба распорядилась иначе и я открыл для себя бесплатный кабинет интернета в Политехе, который меня заворожил, а после того как я случайно нажал CTRL+U на странице <a href=\"http://ya.ru\">ya.ru</a> и увидел разноцветные строки кода — «поплыл» и не могу остановиться до сих пор.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Несколько лет работал в Туле, потом в Москве, потом по стечению обстоятельств попал в деревню под Тулой и мне тут так стало просто и кайфово, что я больше не стал возвращаться в мегаполис. Тут чистый воздух, свое хозяйство, красота, спокойствие и нет городской суеты и пробок, в которых я проводил по 2-4 часа в сутки, живя в большом городе. И так уже 7 лет я удаленщик, не путайте с фрилансом (работаю официально, фултайм).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Фотографии Михаила Кобзарева на отдыхе с сыном\" class=\"wp-image-2529\" srcset=\"https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://ru.wordpress.org/files/2022/08/Mikhail-Kobzarev-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Михаил на отдыхе с сыном</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Но есть и свои минусы: за продуктами, в больницу, стоматологию, кинотеатр приходится ездить в город, но это не является проблемой, когда у тебя есть автомобиль и четкий распорядок дня, когда ты можешь час-два в день отлучиться по личным вопросам.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Сейчас в профессиональных чатах активно обсуждается тема трудоустройства и возникает ощущение, что работодатели и кандидаты не могут друг друга найти.

Действительно ли существует проблема и что нужно делать, чтобы найти работу или нанять подходящего специалиста?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>К сожалению, эта проблема сейчас как снежный ком. Образовалась она не так давно по понятным причинам, в основном из-за оттока специалистов за границу во всех сферах жизни и не только в IT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Мы с ребятами-волонтерами на нашем проекте <a href=\"https://wp-digest.com/vacancies/\">WordPress Jobs</a> стараемся помогать обеим сторонам, чтобы компании находили достойных специалистов, а соискатели — работу мечты.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Сейчас не достаточно просто разместить резюме на сайте HH.ru. Многие компании ушли с рынка и сейчас практически некому заниматься обучением джунов (за исключением таких компаний как Сбер, Яндекс, Тинькофф), все хотят минимум мидлов, которых осталось тоже не так много, поэтому необходимо помимо резюме иметь открытый живой GitHub аккаунт, где рекрутеры смогут увидеть ваши скилы. Желательно крутиться в тематических чатах, куда HR-ы тоже часто заглядывают дабы схантить новых кандидатов. Не стоит забывать про личные блоги (с моего блога на меня приходит 30% заказов) и LinkedIn (правда придется заморочиться с VPN).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>А для компаний один совет — пишите про себя больше и исключительно правду, сейчас всю информацию очень легко проверить, а если работодателя уличат во лжи — доверия от соискателей ждать не стоит. У нас были случаи, когда мы отказывали в размещении вакансий, так как я стараюсь сам лично проверять каждое объявление, «пробивать» компании по открытым базам, общаться с ними лично. Это долго, но снижает процент мошенничества с обеих сторон.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Мы как раз хотим вынести WordPress Jobs на отдельный домен, доработать его, сделать удобный поиск, интеграцию с биржами типа HH.ru и попытаться давать гарантии как это делают фриланс-биржи, добавить возможность менторинга, обучения, но нужно найти заинтересованных спонсоров и участников проекта, а с этим пока не густо.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Порталы по поиску работы рекомендуют делать отдельные резюме точно подходящие под названия вакансий и писать сопроводительное письмо индивидуально каждому работодателю, это весьма трудоемко и поиск работы может растянуться на месяца. Существует другой подход, аналогичный «воронке продаж»&nbsp; — откликнуться на 1000 вакансий и рассчитывать, что после прохождения 30 собеседований получишь 2-3 предложения о работе. Из-за этого HR специалисты тонут под грудами резюме и подходящие кандидаты, не указавшие в своем резюме все нужные ключевые слова теряются в этом потоке. Есть ли выход из сложившийся практики?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Оба подхода имеют место быть, в каждом из них есть свои плюсы и минусы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Первый подход со стороны соискателя позволяет более точечно подстраиваться под вакансии с определенным набором ключевых слов, но на создание такого количества резюме нужно очень много времени и велик шанс ошибиться лишь в одном месте, наплодив ошибку повсеместно, что может негативно сказаться на вас в дальнейшем. Рекрутерам и компаниям здесь проще в поиске соискателя, но не всем нравится копаться в груде одинаковых резюме, где отличается пара абзацев или список скиллов. С их точки зрения это похоже на переспам и плюсов вам особо не добавит. Это больше моё личное мнение и доверять ему на 100% не нужно.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Второй подход я считаю более надежным и проверенным годами, сам им часто пользуюсь. Соискателю достаточно создать резюме на любой площадке или в своём блоге или на GitHub и откликнуться хоть на 100500 вакансий и вы с уверенностью в 99% получите пару-тройку офферов. HR, конечно, закопаются в огромном количестве откликов, но такая у них работа.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тут самое главное найти золотую середину в обоих подходах и составить детализированное резюме. Постараться указать развернуто должность, на которую вы претендуете, все свои hard и soft skills, опыт работы в хронологическом порядке, занимаемую должность, выполняемые обязанности и ваши достижения в каждой из компаний, где вы когда-либо работали.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Высшее образование в текущих реалиях не является обязательным условием приема на работу, но указать его желательно. Многие компании до сих пор требуют наличие диплома о высшем образовании для отчетности, не более того.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Обязательно укажите контакты, по которым с вами можно связаться в реальном времени. Если есть какие-то рекомендательные или сопроводительные письма &#8212; тоже добавьте их к вашему резюме.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Не стоит указывать ничего лишнего.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Если вы устраиваетесь не в русскоязычную компанию, то сделайте копию вашего резюме на английском языке.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Для WordPress существует огромное количество плагинов и тем, создать сайт можно в считанные минуты, и многие разработчики специализируются на «сборке» сайтов и у них даже не возникает необходимости «заглядывать под капот». В результате работодатели не знают с каким стеком технологий разработчик им нужен, а кандидаты претендуют на работу, которая им не подходит. Можно ли кардинально изменить ситуацию?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Работодатель по факту и не должен это знать, это больше задача HR или тех людей с техническими навыками, кто у вас будет проводить в итоге собеседования. К сожалению, уровень знаний HR сейчас тоже оставляет желать лучшего, и очень часто годные специалисты не проходят их отсев, но тут только самим проводить интервью.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ну и стоит справедливо заметить, что существует огромное количество проектов, где технические навыки для соискателя вообще не нужны. Нет необходимости знать PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, чтобы поставить пачку плагинов, потыкать пару кнопок в админке и запустить сайт для проверки какой-то гипотезы или прощупывания ниши. Мы таких специалистов в своём сообществе называем «Модератор админки».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>А есть очень сложные, запутанные проекты с кучей логики, микросервисов и высокой нагрузкой, где без технических знаний ты и дня не продержишься.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Поэтому вакансии должен создавать не руководитель и не менеджер проекта, а технически подкованный специалист, ваш будущий коллега, который на пальцах может расписать в резюме, что же вас ждет на будущей работе.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Опытные разработчики часто находятся в латентном поиске, то есть сидят и ждут, когда работодатель придет и предложит. Это работает? Что делать работодателю, которому нужен специалист на сложный высоконагруженный проект? Есть ли они вообще такие?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я сам постоянно нахожусь в латентном поиске и жду «работу мечты», где мне будет интересно и за это будут соответствующе платить. Это работает, работало и будет работать. И таких специалистов в режиме ожидания достаточно много, обычно они собираются в сообществах в социальных сетях и прекрасно знают друг друга.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Поэтому, если вам нужно найти реально хорошего профессионала на высоконагруженный проект, то нет ничего лучше, чем «сарафанное радио». Гуру обычно уже где-то работают, но если знакомый коллега предложит что-то более интересное, то, скорее всего, у работодателя появится шанс схантить к себе этого человека. Тут главное внимательно посмотреть соцсети, блоги и GitHub аккаунт, чтобы не попасть на простого «разговорника», которые встречаются в любом сообществе. На словах они гуру, а по факту не далеки от джунов.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Что ты посоветуешь тем, кто хочет начать свою карьеру как WordPress-разработчик? Многие курсы предлагают трудоустройство после обучения. Насколько это реально?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Посоветую только одно — не бояться. WordPress не страшный и не монструозный как его обычно описывают поклонники классического ООП и любители фреймворков типа Symfony и Laravel. У него есть EAV (Entity Attribute Value) вместо ORM и EDA (Event Driven Architecture) вместо MVC. Именно из-за этих отличий у многих разработчиков возникает нелюбовь к WordPress — они не понимают архитектуру и не допускают мысли, что почерпнутые в книгах по ООП подходы не являются единственно правильными. Никто не запрещает использовать ООП, PSR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress уже давно не простенькая CMS для создания бложиков. У нее под капотом более <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_APIs\">десятка различных API для разработчика</a>, весь код покрыт юнит-тестами, соответствует стандартам WPCS (WordPress Coding Standards для PHP_CodeSniffer), простой интерфейс для создания CRUD постепенно внедряется так любимое многими разработчиками ООП. На этом движке можно построить проект любой сложности, главное делать это с головой (MVC, headless, CMF).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Не просто так же WordPress <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">уже занял 43%</a> всемирного рынка сайтов в вебе.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Единственное чего пока лично мне не хватает — это удобного интерфейса для работы с кастомными таблицами и поддержки composer для пакетов. Но мы справляемся при помощи WP_List_Table (базовый класс для создания таблиц со списком чего угодно в WordPress. Таблицы поддерживают технологию AJAX. На базе этого класса выводится все виды таблиц в админ-панели WordPress).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Трудоустройство после курсов вполне реально и многие компании именно так и поступают — сами себе выращивают специалистов и пытаются их как-то заинтересовать и замотивировать, чтобы готовые к употреблению разработчики не разбежались (подбирают интересные проекты, благодарят финансово).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Если вы думаете, что на WordPress нельзя заработать более 60.000 рублей в месяц, то вы ошибаетесь, рынок труда просто огромен, количество проектов еще больше и ценником в 300.000 рублей в месяц уже никого не удивишь.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Читайте книги, гуглите Яндексом и почаще посещайте <a href=\"https://wp-kama.ru/\">ВП-Каму</a>.

Второе — те вещи, которые приносят деньги, позволяют и содержать семью и поддерживать баланс между работой и творчеством.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Основное направление деятельности за последние полгода — это развитие видеостудии. Несмотря на то, что youtube-каналу WordPrеss Moscow уже несколько лет, профессиональная запись видео — совершенно новая для меня область. Пока прокачиваю техническую составляющую. Надеюсь это заметно по качеству роликов, которые выходят на канале.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Из планов до конца года — развивать youtube-канал, социальные сети, искать спонсоров, предлагать новые форматы встреч: картинг, боулинг, пейнтбол, игра в мафию, чередуя их с классическими митапами.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Пока глобальное сообщество только планирует возобновление физических митапов, мы же их уже во всю проводим. В чем идея предстоящего митапа и есть ли планы на следующие?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Да, пандемия сильно подкосила живые встречи, к концу 19-го года мы вышли на стабильные 50+ участников. А первые живые встречи в этом году собирали по 10-15 человек, желающих выступить было мало и приходилось экспериментировать с форматами. Например, были игры в настолки, или в одну из встреч мы сели небольшим кружочком и проговорили о WordPress 2,5 часа. Просто накидывая темы, задавая вопросы, рассказывая кейсах и делясь опытом. Глобальной идеи у предстоящего митапа нет, но есть амбиции. Надеюсь, 20-й митап станет серьезным шагом в развитии WordPress-сообщества в Москве.<br><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LICB-mES3k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=ru-RU&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Приглашение на большой московский митап WordPress-разработчиков №20</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Ты стоял у истоков организации WordPress митапов в Москве и этот митап должен иметь номер #65. Почему нумерация сбилась и что еще изменилось за это время?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ну не совсем так, в 13-м году я впервые попал на митап, который устраивал Константин Ковшенин. Это был взрыв мозга: интересные люди, классные темы, возможность задать вопросы или рассказать что-нибудь самому. Костя заряжал своей энергетикой и мотивировал. Я посещал каждый митап, и где-то на 4 встрече выступил с докладом про сайты-портфолио. Доклад получился классным и Костя пригласил выступить на WordCamp Russia 2013, первом WordCamp’е в России. Так прошло 6 лет, выступал с докладами на митапах и был спикером на каждом WordCamp’е в Москве. Так сказать, активный участник сообщества, но в организации почти не участвовал. Летом 2017 года прошел последний митап и наступило затишье.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Эстафету продолжил <a href=\"https://ru.wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-denis-yanchevskiy/\">Денис Янчевский</a>, он организовал официальную группу WordPress Krasnogorsk, а через несколько встреч, митапы перебрались в Москву и на meetup.com появился <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/wordpress-moscow/\">WordPress Moscow</a>. Так как WordPress Moscow получилось производной от WordPress Krasnogorsk, а не предыдущих 45 митапов, то и нумерацию мы начали с 1. Где-то на третьей встрече я предложил свою помощь и стал участвовать в организации митапов. На тот момент у меня не было глобальных целей, мне нравилось тусовка и хотелось внести свой вклад в подготовку мероприятий. До начала пандемии мы делили организаторские обязанности 50/50. Во время пандемии было вынужденное затишье с редкими онлайн-встречами, ну и в «новом сезоне» я уже организую митапы самостоятельно.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Что дает участие в митапах для слушателей, спикеров и волонтеров? Как получить максимум пользы от посещения</em></strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Каждый может найти в митапах полезное для себя. Для новичков это возможность задать вопросы, получить помощь, на живых примерах увидеть направления и пути развития. Для опытных разработчиков — найти единомышленников, партнеров, подрядчиков или новые заказы. Для спикеров — возможность «материализовать» свои знания и умения, проверить их актуальность, получить статус эксперта, заработать «социальные очки», плюс митап — хорошая площадка для тренировки ораторских навыков, здесь лояльная аудитория и нет завышенных требований как на больших конференциях.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Организация большого мероприятия затратный процесс, требующий много сил, внимания, времени. Это ответственность. Но когда все получается, когда участники уходят заряженные, когда каждый получил пользу — приходит умиротворение, чувство наполненности, понимание, что ты на своем месте и делаешь свое дело. Для волонтеров это возможность разделить эти чувства, быть причастными к большому событию.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чтобы получит пользу от митапа для начала нужно решить а для чего ты туда идешь. Хочешь найти подрядчиков или новый проект — распечатай визитки, чтобы проще налаживать коммуникацию. Заинтересовала конкретная тема доклада — узнай побольше о спикере, подготовь вопросы, конспектируй во время выступления. Есть затык в проекте, нужна помощь или совет, перерывы между докладами — лучшее время. Обычно участники делятся на небольшие группы и что-то обсуждают, ищи схожую тему, задавай вопросы, будь коммуникабелен. В идеале, приди с ноутбуком, сделай так, чтобы суть проблемы можно было быстро увидеть, получить доступ к коду и настройкам сайта. Так шанс получить помощь оперативно намного выше.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Что делать тем, кто хочет выступить и какие темы актуальны для митапов?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Двери для спикеров всегда открыты. Для начала разговора напишите мне в <a href=\"https://t.me/solidcreature\">телеграм</a>. У меня ровно один критерий к докладам — тема должна быть интересна аудитории сообщества.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Если человек выступает в первый раз, то предварительно проводим тестовый онлайн-прогон доклада. Это помогает исправить мелкие ошибки, правильно расставить акценты, потренировать подачу материала.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Очень часто люди недооценивают свои знания и опыт. Тысячу раз я слышал «ну что я буду рассказывать, это и так все знают». Зачастую достаточно 2-3 интересных кейса или нестандартная предметная область, чтобы подготовить хороший доклад.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Иногда люди активно сопротивляются и не хотят выступать на публике. Так для 19-го митапа мне пришлось включить всю свою харизму, и силу убеждения, чтобы у митапа появились докладчики. <br><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zgPyP2Zwzc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=ru-RU&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>— Интересна ли спонсорам поддержка митапов и что сообщество WordPress может им предложить?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>У нас вполне понятная и состоявшаяся аудитория, это молодые люди 25-35 лет, с опытом разработки от 3-х лет и более.

This flaw could allow unauthorized visitors to gain Administrator-level access to a site. Patchstack’s Rafie Muhammad confirmed: “We were able to determine that a brute force attack that iterates all 1 million known possible values for the security hash and passes them in the litespeed_hash cookie — even running at a relatively low 3 requests per second — is able to gain access to the site as any given user ID”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence explained that the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/08/over-5000000-site-owners-affected-by-critical-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-patched-in-litespeed-cache-plugin/\">vulnerability</a> is “due to the plugin not properly restricting the role simulation functionality allowing a user to set their current ID to that of an administrator, if they have access to a valid hash which can be found in the debug logs or through brute force. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their user ID to that of an administrator, and then create a new user account with the administrator role utilizing the /wp-json/wp/v2/users REST API endpoint.” They also cautioned: “We have no doubts that this vulnerability will be actively exploited very soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This vulnerability does not affect Windows-based WordPress instances but poses a risk to those running on other operating systems, such as Linux. “This vulnerability highlights the critical importance of ensuring the strength and unpredictability of values that are used as security hashes or nonces. The rand() and mt_rand() functions in PHP return values that may be “random enough” for many use cases, but they are not unpredictable enough to be used in security-related features.”, Rafie Muhammad added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, the LiteSpeed Cache plugin patched an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/litespeed-cache-5-7-patches-xss-vulnerability\">XSS vulnerability</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incidentally, Wordfence launched the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordfence-launches-wordpress-superhero-challenge-with-big-rewards\">WordPress Superhero Challenge</a> last week as part of its ongoing Bug Bounty Program to report critical or high-severity vulnerabilities in plugins or themes with over 5 million active installs, offering a top bounty prize of $31,200.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 17:33:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"Do The Woo Community: Development, Digital Accessibility and AI with Niels de Blaauw and Marius Vetrici\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85295\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://dothewoo.io/development-digital-accessibility-and-ai-with-niels-de-blaauw-and-marius-vetrici/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44409:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-4 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-3 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-1 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-1 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"600\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GoDaddy-square.png?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"GoDaddy\" class=\"wp-image-75131\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-2\"> <strong><a href=\"https://godaddy.com\">GoDaddy</a></strong>: Build your clients sites using the flexibility of a <strong>Managed WooCommerce Store from GoDaddy</strong>.

I work as the Technical Director at a Dutch WordPress agency called Level Level. And with me today is Marius Vetrici.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Hi everyone, and thanks for the intro, Niels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So to get started, I&#8217;ve been in web development for over 13 years now and got started with WordPress eight years ago at Level Level. There, we make bespoke WordPress websites for e-commerce, Dutch government, banks, NGOs, and more. We do that with a focus on digital accessibility. Other than that, we have an e-learning platform for accessibility called The Collective and maintain open-source software such as the WooCommerce testing automation library. And Marius, you are the founder of WordPress Riders, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Oh yeah, actually I&#8217;m the founder of WordPress Riders Agency and e-Commerce Tools plugins. We have a child business, which is building and selling WooCommerce-based plugins. In terms of background, we are a software development company. We started with WordPress about nine and a half years ago, currently serving customers in Switzerland and in the US. We help build and maintain large web portals, e-commerce platforms with WooCommerce, but also with Shopify. We also work with LMSs. Besides web development, I have an interest in AI, do more and more research on this, and build AI-based solutions and provide advisory on how to meet with AI. With WordPress, I jumped on the WordPress boat, I think, 15 years ago when I started blogging. And 10 years ago, as a freelancer, I started serving customers, and then slowly that freelancing one-man show converted into an agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So there&#8217;s a lot of different things that you&#8217;ve done to grow into all of these roles, right? Was it natural for you to grow into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, it was organic indeed. It started as a one-man show; currently, we&#8217;re 22 people. But somehow, I was lucky to build on prior experience. I had another software company for 10 years, building products using .NET technologies, document management, and inventory management. So I kind of leveraged all of that into this conversion from being a freelancer to running the agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />One thing we have in common is that we both come from non-WordPress development backgrounds and then moved into working with WordPress. I think having prior work knowledge of WordPress helped me hit the ground running, and with quality documentation, the risk for beginners was quite low. It was easy to get into, even though the documentation has improved quite a bit over the years. So how was that for you? Were there any big hurdles getting into WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />I don&#8217;t think there were any hurdles because the learning curve for WordPress was so much lower before JavaScript and Gutenberg. It used to be much lower than with other technologies. So I don&#8217;t think there was any hurdle. I was pretty lucky to ride a couple of waves. I had the technical background, and it took me one month to get up to speed with WordPress and actually start serving clients as a freelancer, thanks to my prior 10-plus years of experience in coding. Then, I was lucky to join the early stages of the Codeable freelancer platform, which gave me a steady flow of customers. It also educated me on customer communication and setting expectations. So yeah, that was a very fortunate combination of factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Getting into WordPress, at first, I was amazed at how much it did out of the box, mainly around data management. Before WordPress, I must have written the same &#8220;Is this an email address?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this input field actually a valid URL?&#8221; validators hundreds of times. WordPress just makes these repetitive things so easy. It frees up so much time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Again and again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, so you can make WordPress as difficult as you want yourself. A lot of best practices from the rest of the PHP world have been adopted now by WordPress developers like our agency as well. So things like object-oriented programming, static analyzers, dependency injection, design patterns, unit and integration testing, code reviews, dependency management with Composer—all these things are part of our current workflow now. But there are a lot of moving parts, and the community is providing a lot of go-to plugins that might not be up to our standard. So how do you manage this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />That&#8217;s a very interesting perspective, and thanks for sharing. I was actually talking to scores, dozens of hardcore developers, non-WordPress developers, and I keep hearing them say the same thing again and again: &#8220;Oh, WordPress, it&#8217;s not even object-oriented, no design patterns. This is below my current level.&#8221; I was like, okay, that seems like an opportunity for us. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m very happy to meet a like-minded fellow like yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, it gets messy fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And I actually see a bit of a challenge here. As you mentioned automated testing, from my perspective, I keep seeing this challenge. Again, comparing other technologies with WordPress, with Java Enterprise Edition, or maybe with .NET, all the updates and changes are mostly being managed by somebody, a centralized entity, which is obviously good and bad. But here, when you own a website—I&#8217;m not even talking about building a website at an agency—when you are a client and you have at least 20 plugins, let&#8217;s say at least 20 plugins, each of them having their own version, you are basically responsible for the integration testing of those plugins. You are responsible for making sure that they work. And of course, at the end of the day, you hire an agency to do that for you. But when you have so many moving parts, each of them being built by a third party, each of them releasing new versions randomly, I mean, this is an amount of work that probably not many website owners are really aware of. How do you deal with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So one thing we do is we rely heavily on integration testing within our projects. We test critical parts of a website both through automation and manual testing. We mention to a lot of clients that issues that pop up for one customer or lessons learned from the next project benefit all our clients because we manage more sites like them. So you&#8217;re on both sides of the equation, right? On one hand, you are managing an agency with these issues related to plugins, updating, and compatibility. On the other hand, you&#8217;re building plugins yourself and can only test so much. So how do you balance this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Actually, that&#8217;s a very good question. Before we decide to build a feature for our plugins—by the way, the plugins are related to subscriptions; one of them is called &#8220;Buy One or Subscribe,&#8221; and the other one is called &#8220;Self-Service Commerce Subscriptions&#8221;—before deciding to launch a new feature, we always think about the total cost of ownership of that feature, including the future maintenance and updates to that feature. When you look at a feature through that lens, if it requires some integration with third-party plugins, let&#8217;s say with Woo Bundles or Woo Composite Products, we know that&#8217;s going to factor in an exponential amount of work and updates and maintenance because those plugins will randomly change. So to answer your question, we try to build our features as self-contained as possible, with as few dependencies as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />And with the plugins that you mentioned, they&#8217;re mostly plugins built by Woo with the Automattic team behind them. So these are somewhat stable, reliable products, even though they&#8217;re moving fast and changing things. There&#8217;s a bigger picture, and there&#8217;s also, of course, a single-entity builders that create a product and then abandon it after two or three months, which you have to take care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />I&#8217;m not even talking about those who abandon it. And that&#8217;s a very good example with Automattic. Even with Automattic, you get certain updates inside the code that just come, they just hit you. It is what it is. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s good or bad; it&#8217;s a fact of life. But someone needs to take care of all of that. And you mentioned before our talk that you rely heavily on automated testing, the shopping carts, and making sure everything actually works. How are you doing that? Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So we&#8217;re talking about total cost of ownership for our customers. It&#8217;s almost always more expensive to have a failing critical process. People can&#8217;t buy the products on the website because they&#8217;re spending on advertising. These people are reaching the website trying to buy a product, and if things don&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s not only missed revenue, but also they&#8217;re incurring costs to get these customers. So keeping the business-critical processes alive is the number one priority for us. When we&#8217;re talking about having 20-plus plugins that integrate with each other and then having the bespoke layer on top of it, like we do for most of our customers, we really need to make sure that everything keeps working. One of the things we do is we have an open-sourced testing library called WordPress Browser WooCommerce, and it&#8217;s an extension on top of WordPress Browser, which allows WooCommerce developers to write tests in the same way that you would for WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the factories from WordPress core unit tests, like this-&gt;factory-&gt;user-&gt;create or this-&gt;post-&gt;create, we also make the WooCommerce functions available in the same manner. So now suddenly there&#8217;s this-&gt;factory-&gt;order-&gt;create, or product-&gt;create, or coupon-&gt;create, or shipping_zone-&gt;create. All these sometimes difficult-to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-test things, like &#8220;We&#8217;re shipping to 20 different countries, but they all have their own business rules,&#8221; are automatable through this library. We create scenarios for every single feature that we build to keep them tested through integration so that we make sure that every single part of the chain of plugins is working as we expect. So when there&#8217;s an update to a Cost of Goods plugin, we can update it, see if the test fails, and then fix either the way we integrate with it. Another thing that guards us from these unexpected updates—and this is mostly related to changes in the programming interface—is that we&#8217;re heavy users of PHPStan, like the static analyzer, which shows us &#8220;This function is deprecated,&#8221; or &#8220;This function has a different parameter signature after the latest release.&#8221; So there are a lot of safeguards to capture issues early. That’s one of the most important things that we&#8217;re working on. And I think one of the things we mentioned in our pre-talk is that you don&#8217;t, or you have fewer of these issues when comparing Woo to other platforms like Shopify. Do you have any experience with Shopify and the direction it&#8217;s going as opposed to Woo and the direction Woo is going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />The experience is, as with anything else, it&#8217;s about changing the problems you deal with. When you move from one country to another, you actually change the problems you&#8217;re dealing with. Same with changing platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />I think you&#8217;re not actually solving the issues; you&#8217;re just moving to different issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And sometimes you&#8217;re choosing to solve some unknown issues you weren&#8217;t even aware you were going to have to solve. But getting specific about Shopify, I kept watching the Google Trends, WooCommerce versus Shopify, for quite a while. For the last one or two years, I was writing some articles on that and performing some analysis myself. The difference is like five to one, five times more searches for Shopify than for WooCommerce as reported not by individual keyword searches but by Google Trends. And this eventually translated into almost a change of market share. It depends on the source you&#8217;re looking at, but they&#8217;re both on average around each at 25%. Some would report 20 to 30 WooCommerce versus Shopify, some would say 30 to 20. And in terms of problems, I think Shopify has created an excellent user experience team, great product managers. Basically, they have built an excellent wizard. If you remember the old-time wizards like a step-by-step wizard, they will just ask some questions and then they&#8217;ll point you in the right direction later. WooCommerce picked up as well. They came with their own wizard that pops up and helps you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />For the first setup experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />For the first setup, but yeah, they came in after Shopify, as per my knowledge. But still, I think the Shopify experience is better. So with WooCommerce, those who are in the WooCommerce community, I think we still have some things to learn from the other guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />One of the things that impressed me about Shopify is the last two steps in the checkout experience, the way you check out. A lot of forms are pre-filled based on things you might have entered on other platforms. For WooCommerce, you&#8217;re really dependent on the payment gateway you&#8217;re using to fill in stuff automatically. And the Shopify platform makes this a cleaner experience in my eyes for the end user. So I think there&#8217;s a big opportunity for payment gateway providers to look at how Shopify is doing these last two steps from selecting the payment method and paying itself and copy it, just steal it. It&#8217;s better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />I would guess that they got, I won&#8217;t say they stole it, but they got inspired by Stripe, which was the first in the market that actually built an excellent payment experience. And let&#8217;s face it, that checkout process is the reason to exist for the shop, for our work, for our agencies when we build e-commerce. And that little chain at the end is not perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />We&#8217;re actually talking with a couple of payment providers because we also have an accessibility consultancy business. We have three certified accessibility professionals on our team, and we&#8217;re now talking with several payment providers, payment gateways, to get their checkouts accessible for people with keyboard accessibility issues or people using screen readers. Every year, we do research on the biggest e-commerce platforms in the Netherlands and how accessible they are. For eight out of 15, you are not able to reach the final steps of the checkout with just the keyboard. So there&#8217;s a big opportunity for a lot of WooCommerce shops or WooCommerce shop owners to get a bit of a competitive edge because if you are the one doing accessibility or getting your checkout accessible, you&#8217;re blowing away the competition on other WooCommerce shops or on other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And besides the competition, there&#8217;s the legal compliance in most of the countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />And especially next year, there&#8217;s the European Accessibility Act coming through, which forces European countries to have legislation for the accessibility of web shops that make more than 2 million in revenue a year or have more than 10 employees. So next year in June, there&#8217;s going to be pressure on everyone to make sure that their web shop is accessible. And I&#8217;m expecting a lot of shops to handle this the same way that they did with the privacy legislation—look the other way for as long as possible until it&#8217;s too late and then start implementing it. Our experience teaches us that the process of getting your organization up to speed with accessibility, making the changes needed, and making sure that it&#8217;s legally compliant is a process of several months. So if it&#8217;s going to be next June that you have to be compliant, you&#8217;d better start now, or you&#8217;re going to be too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />I actually have positive examples on this end. One of our customers invented and patented a device, a gear, they&#8217;re manufacturing it for professional tennis players and they&#8217;re selling it all over the world. A few months ago, we had this talk with them, and we got a couple of people on our team certified in accessibility, and we had to implement quite a few changes there just so they are prepared. But they have done it not because of the European Act—they are based in Europe, but outside of the EU—they have done it literally for business reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />That&#8217;s what I always say. The stick is the European Accessibility Act—you have to do it because it&#8217;s the law—but there&#8217;s a huge carrot. I don&#8217;t understand how every marketer is focused on performance. Everyone likes a fast website, right? Faster is better. Google rewards fast websites. This is the mentality. But for accessibility, it&#8217;s exactly the same. An accessible website is a benefit for everyone. If you break your arm, you&#8217;re temporarily disabled, and you have to find another way to use a website that you like to shop on. People who can use accessibility features spend longer on your website. User engagement goes up, and a lot of the changes that you&#8217;re making are not even visible to the end user. They&#8217;re just good UX, good user experience that you&#8217;re building. Not having to press tab 120 times to put something in your cart or having the autocomplete for your address actually make sense. So it&#8217;s a process that benefits everyone, and there&#8217;s a very large segment of people that actually benefit directly from a better accessible experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And I was recently talking to somebody here in Switzerland, and they were so frustrated with a website from a pretty big company here called Manor because they had a really hard time checking out. They said, &#8220;Hey Marius, why won&#8217;t you reach out to them and tell them this and tell them that?&#8221; And that was someone who wouldn&#8217;t normally need accessibility features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />We work with the biggest retailers in the Netherlands. These are companies making hundreds of millions in revenue every year. We&#8217;re testing, like A/B testing, the accessible variants as opposed to the non-accessible variants to gather data on how much more effective it actually is to have an accessible &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; button or an accessible search function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And on the accessibility and automated testing, we played a lot with some legacy frameworks. Years ago, we started with Codeception, and after writing quite a few thousands of lines of code, we eventually realized that it was a waste of time—it wasn&#8217;t reliable. You would execute the same script two times in the same browser, and you would get different results and errors. So we eventually switched over to Cypress, which is client-side JavaScript, and that worked pretty well for us. So now, for certain clients, we do run batteries of tests as well just to make sure this integration problem doesn&#8217;t fall on their shoulders and that we can give them peace of mind that their checkout still works. You also mentioned in the beginning that you work for some government websites and large e-commerce websites. Maybe you can share a few notable projects?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So for e-commerce, we&#8217;re doing a large project, which is a web shop in 10 European countries that makes plastic sheets to measure. You can order online different shapes of plastic sheets, and we&#8217;ve integrated the WooCommerce store from these 10 different shops into a back office where they&#8217;re actually on the factory floor, seeing the orders come in live on the table saws and on lasers. We&#8217;ve made an interface where all these orders are combined and then produced from the tablets in the factory. So it&#8217;s really a full-service, full-flow web shop. And for governments, yeah, we&#8217;re working for our local governments in the Netherlands, state government, and the national government on a couple of projects. What&#8217;s interesting is that we&#8217;re learning lessons from e-commerce that we can then apply to the government because needing a new passport is much like the same checkout flow that you would see in the awareness and decision stages, but there&#8217;s no competitor on the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you still need to guide people through this funnel, and you need to get them to the next step because if they&#8217;re not</p>\n\n\n\n<p>entering the next step, the intent is really high. So if they&#8217;re not going from starting the application form to finishing the application form, there&#8217;s obviously something confusing about the form. So there are a lot of lessons that we can take from these different types of projects in our portfolio that we can move to other industries, businesses, and verticals in the same way. There are really high security and privacy rules and expectations for governments, banks, and insurers. We&#8217;re taking the lessons we&#8217;re learning there and applying them back to e-commerce to make sure the processes are done in a way that updates are safe, and we have data reliability—all these types of lessons learned from this vertical that really appreciates the security aspects of WordPress development, and we&#8217;re moving it into the &#8220;move fast, break things&#8221; part of WooCommerce development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />WordPress development done right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Agree with you, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That&#8217;s basically it. That should be the tagline of the agency—WordPress development done right. So how is this experience for you? Because obviously, with the very broad spectrum of customers that you have with the WooCommerce plugins, you must have a lot of different experiences between types of customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty broad, and it ranges from shops selling dog food, pet food on a subscription, or even toothbrushes on a subscription, and so on, to some very, very high-profile customers such as Panasonic. We actually built their e-commerce platforms for a couple of countries, and that was an extremely challenging project to be built with WooCommerce because they wanted tons of features that you would normally get for a ton of money on other platforms—more expensive platforms like Magento, the Adobe experience, or maybe a platform from SAP. But here they wanted to get all of that on WooCommerce. Basically, all the learnings and the knowledge gathered from more than a thousand projects had to be condensed into the Panasonic website and reviewed for the code of some of the plugins because they actually wanted us to use some plugins in order to &#8220;move fast, break things.&#8221; Now, the Czech Republic and Poland are running on WooCommerce, which is something our team is very proud of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Can you share something about what your review process looks like for onboarding plugins made by third parties?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, sure. We have a list of preferred plugins, which we have reviewed the code for, and we do monitor the code quality of the plugins using PHP CodeSniffer with a WordPress set of rules for security and code formatting and compliance. We also use a couple of tools to check the security of the code besides manually reviewing it, but it&#8217;s always good to use things such as Snyk to go through the code and other tools. Actually, building on this need of our customers—the need being, &#8220;Hey, is this a good or bad plugin?&#8221;—we&#8217;re about to launch WPPluginReview.com, which will be a website that will automatically review the quality of the code using DevOps approaches, like automated approaches, and assign certain color codes just like with fridges—the energy label for the fridge, A, B, C, D, or for buildings. We&#8217;re building this for plugins so that a non-technical person will immediately be able to grasp whether this is a trustworthy or not trustworthy plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />So you&#8217;re making the process of selecting a plugin and comparing different plugins in the same space easier by showing that this has a &#8220;D&#8221; score on your automated tests for plugin quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, and going beyond just comparing features because features are already being compared all over the internet, but comparing the quality of the code for now requires developers&#8217; time to actually go through the code and review it. So yeah, we&#8217;re trying to automate this part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, so one thing we&#8217;re also taking into consideration is that we internally have a point system that we give to plugins, and it&#8217;s partially based on the hard factors that you&#8217;re sharing. Does it comply with PHP coding standards for the WordPress standard? Does it have any known security issues—these kinds of things? But also the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Number of database queries is also an important factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />And if they have filters and actions available to hook into how they&#8217;re doing things, right? Because it&#8217;s easy to do things the wrong way in WooCommerce. So seeing these positive signals on plugins, and we also take into account some soft factors. Are they continually updating WooCommerce plugins? You have this README.txt property called &#8220;compatible with&#8221; or &#8220;tested up to.&#8221; Are these up to date with the current version or maybe the previous? Because if it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s going to be like a score penalty for us, deducting points from the plugin. Or do they have a clear revenue or monetization component? If they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s going to be a liability for us because the creator might abandon the project if they don&#8217;t have a financial motive to continue working on the project. So we have these couple of soft factors that we also take into account when grading plugins. From this, it gets to a score where we say, like, 75 points or above, we&#8217;re like, okay, we don&#8217;t have any serious concerns, let&#8217;s do this. And then 75 to 50 points, we go to the customer and advise them: &#8220;These are our concerns. Do you want to push on and bet on this, or do you want to reconsider or compare other products in the space?&#8221; And then below 50, we highly discourage our customers from using these kinds of plugins because it&#8217;s going to be a business risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s a clever way to do it, to rank the plugins. Changing topics a bit, before we wrap up today—you are on the very technical side of things, and currently, I run the commercial side of the business—I would be curious from your perspective if you were to… two things I have to ask you. If you were to give advice for other agency owners who don&#8217;t have a CTO by their side, when should they consider getting a CTO by their side? At what point, at what size of the agency, when is this a good time? And the second thing is, what would you expect, or ideally, what would a CTO of an agency expect from the CEO to be or to have in order to foster the best possible collaboration that is the goal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, so one of the things that makes my job as a Technical Director easy is that we have a very clear focus on WordPress and WooCommerce. There are all these new technologies constantly popping up around, for example, headless SaaS that do one thing really well. And then a lot of people get hyped up by the availability of these kinds of technologies, jump on board, and then figure out, like you said before, that you&#8217;re not solving issues, you&#8217;re just having different issues. If you have a very clear vision of the core technologies that you use and a very stable base of things that you develop on, then you can have some freedom putting things on top of it. So if you&#8217;re always working with WordPress and WooCommerce, or if you&#8217;re always working with Shopify, then you can move some parts around without endangering your business or having to retrain your whole company. They call it &#8220;building&#8221; if that stable base is missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Exactly. It&#8217;s a stable base. It&#8217;s about building and consolidating probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, and also, once you have that stable base, it&#8217;s easier to tell the story to customers, to either employees, about why you are choosing X and not Y, why you&#8217;re choosing a certain technology and not chasing the other, right? Because it becomes easier to make choices for certain technologies. And then on the opposite side, when you don&#8217;t have a clear vision from the get-go about what is the stable base and what are the dynamic, movable parts, then it&#8217;s time to get a CTO because then you need someone to figure out what this stable base is going to be. What is going to be the technology that we can build on now that&#8217;s still going to be available and relevant in five years? What are the trends going to be in developer experience, and how do we make sure that we don&#8217;t fall behind on the developer experience while maintaining the stable base? Right? These are the tasks that, in my eyes, the Technical Director has mostly—keep things predictable but also steadily moving in the right direction regarding developer experience, stability of the platform that you&#8217;re building, and customer experience. And then, as the second part of your question, since you have a mostly technical background too, but you&#8217;re now more in the CEO position, I would say the hardest thing for CEOs and Technical Directors is balancing innovation with business goals. On one hand, you&#8217;re trying to create new things, create a &#8220;wow&#8221; experience for your customers. At the same time, you have to move into a space where things are known, and not everything is new every single time, which costs a lot of time and reduces predictability. I think the most important thing a CEO can do is be very clear on what the expectations are regarding business goals because this also determines how much room there is for innovation. How is your experience, since you have both experiences, in managing and balancing these two parts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />I came to realize that both are very important—balancing both the short- and medium-term profitability but also the long-term ability to stay in the market. So for now, I&#8217;m just allocating my personal time with a percentage such as 20 to 80—20% for innovation. Actually, this percentage was valid one year ago. I was doing roughly one day per week for innovation and strategizing and market research, and 80% doing the day-to-day stuff. Ever since I moved this year to Switzerland, we actually have a new CEO. It&#8217;s our former CEO. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not running the company anymore since March. I shifted this percentage. Now I&#8217;m more onto 95% looking into the markets, experimenting, talking to various business people at various levels from the C-suite down to the one-person entrepreneurs, not even the local entrepreneurs. Also, because I&#8217;m technical, I am experimenting a lot with AI nowadays because there is this wave, and I&#8217;m trying to understand—do we want to ride it? Can we ride it? And I&#8217;m writing myself some prototypes to understand how it works. Why am I doing this? It&#8217;s again, to be able to understand—do we want to be there in one, two, three years? Are we able to? And that gives me the necessary bones for the meat to be put on when we have a conversation with somebody about AI. I don&#8217;t just &#8220;blah blah&#8221; by reading some articles; I actually try the OpenAPI, and I know how it works. I know the limitations firsthand, and that helps a lot in being able to both better understand what customers want and need and what can actually be achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also helps with having meaningful conversations with any future person responsible in our company for AI, like a dedicated CTO or Technical Director for AI projects, eventually AI advisory AI projects. So to answer your question, basically it&#8217;s about allocating a percentage of the time for the present. Normally, I would say for somebody who is doing day-to-day operations, I would say it&#8217;s 90% of the time focused on existing clients. But don&#8217;t forget about the future—at least 10% of the time to be spent on just reading newsletters. I know for some people this doesn&#8217;t sound like work. It sounds like wasting time. So it&#8217;s fine to waste 10% of the time just looking around and reading and trying,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Being ready for opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />And seeing them—creating the space for you to see the opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Right. So how are you experiencing the volatile space of AI at the moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Different trends, different forces. I&#8217;m waiting to see the checks and balances that will come into play, including the regulatory compliances. What I see is a lot of buzz, a lot of HUE effect thanks to the popularization of large language models through ChatGPT. At the same time, while they do lower the costs of their tokens and the usage of ChatGPT, it&#8217;s still heavily subsidized. So I&#8217;m waiting to see when the real price kicks in, what&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s interesting to create a new SaaS product and a new plugin just based on ChatGPT, but then you have this huge vendor bargaining power. You just have one single vendor you&#8217;re building your business on, and if they cut your trunk, you&#8217;re in the air, and it&#8217;ll take a while to rewire yourself to Bard or to the Amazon AI and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these are all of the risks that you need to take into consideration when considering going with AI. But for some processes inside of the company, I am a huge fan of using AI, for example, to sort data, to search through knowledge bases. You can connect ChatGPT to an API, and you can basically start talking, chatting with your HubSpot and get the latest reports. You can talk with your bank statements through ChatGPT nowadays and ask about your spending trends. Or if you&#8217;re a CFO, you can talk to your Xero through the API and get financial forecasts, which opens up some interesting avenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting to see AI at the moment as a virtual assistant, like assisting in getting data and insights instead of doing the actual work. If you have a Copilot integration when programming, you&#8217;re seeing a lot of suggestions, but you also always need the oversight of an experienced developer to evaluate what it&#8217;s suggesting to you. Does this contain any security issues, or is this a nightmare for maintainability—these kinds of judgments? You need someone to manage these. But at the same time, I&#8217;ve looked up the syntax for the PHP date function a million times in my life, and now I just tell it I want this format and make it for me. Or when writing tests, I&#8217;m like, all right, I need 5,000 postcodes from these eight different countries. I don&#8217;t have to make up a list of these kinds of repetitive things anymore; I just have to check if it&#8217;s right, instead of generating it myself. It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s also got a long way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />It is, it is. And there&#8217;s a long way to go. There&#8217;s a huge reason for which tools like Copilot and the AI assistant, for example, from Cloud AI, which is good with coding, or the AI assistant from JetBrains that lives inside PHPStorm, which is also very good. The reason for which there&#8217;s a long way to go before—and I&#8217;m not sure that these things will ever be able to replace developers—but they will make developers so much more productive and faster. Here&#8217;s a metaphor; it&#8217;s like a story I can quickly share with you. Years ago, when I was studying probability, one of our professors in mathematics and statistics said, &#8220;Imagine you have a monkey randomly typing on the keyboard. Now, please calculate the probability of the monkey typing in the <em>Three Musketeers</em> novel.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Okay. What we have now is we have a very smart monkey that&#8217;s typing on your keyboard, but it&#8217;s still typing randomly—kind of randomly with a very well-trained randomness—but it&#8217;s actually guessing what the next character should be based on the previous characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />A context-aware monkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />It&#8217;s a context-aware monkey. Some call it a very fancy autocomplete that tries to please you—always to please you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah. So my current experience has been it makes good programmers faster, it makes bad programmers worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, that makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />That&#8217;s my current experience. There’s a category of programmers that are still very much going through the learning curve and growing from the junior position. Three or four years ago, they would be the ones copying Stack Overflow answers and putting them into production code, and that&#8217;s now shifted from copying from Stack Overflow to auto-completing from Copilot. That&#8217;s the shift, but it&#8217;s still the same problem. I think that&#8217;s the key insight—that you&#8217;re not removing issues, you&#8217;re just changing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Yeah, I agree with you on this one. Well, I think it&#8217;s time to wrap up for today, Niels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, thank you for the interesting conversation. I&#8217;ve learned a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Same here, Niels, and let&#8217;s keep in touch offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Definitely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />It&#8217;s my first time doing this chat, so I would love to be able to keep in touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Yeah, we&#8217;ll definitely do that. I&#8217;ll see you at the next WordCamp Europe. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marius:<br />Sounds good. All right, take care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niels:<br />Alright, have a good day. Take care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo AgencyChat</em></strong>, guest co-hosts <strong>Niels de Blaauw</strong>, Technical Director at the Dutch WordPress agency Level Level, and <strong>Marius Vetrici</strong>, founder of WordPress Riders Agency share their journeys into WordPress development, the challenges and opportunities in building and maintaining WordPress and WooCommerce sites, the importance of digital accessibility, and the impact of AI on web development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also explores the balance between innovation and stability in agency work, the role of automated testing, and the evolving landscape of e-commerce platforms like WooCommerce and Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of a Stable Technology Base</strong>: Both Niels and Marius emphasize the significance of having a stable core technology base (e.g., WordPress and WooCommerce) while allowing flexibility in other areas. This helps maintain predictability and efficiency in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in WordPress and WooCommerce Development</strong>: Managing a WordPress site with multiple plugins can be complex, requiring rigorous testing and careful integration to ensure everything functions correctly, especially with frequent updates from different third-party developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital Accessibility as a Competitive Advantage</strong>: Ensuring digital accessibility not only helps with legal compliance but also improves user experience, potentially giving businesses a competitive edge. The upcoming European Accessibility Act will put pressure on web shops to be accessible by June next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Innovation and Business Goals</strong>: Agency leaders need to balance the push for innovation with the need to meet business objectives. Allocating time and resources to both areas is crucial for long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automation and Testing</strong>: Automated testing, especially for WooCommerce sites, is critical in ensuring that business-critical processes remain functional despite updates. Using tools like PHPStan and open-source testing libraries can help catch issues early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of AI in Development</strong>: AI is seen as a tool to enhance productivity, particularly in data handling and code generation. However, it requires oversight from experienced developers to avoid potential issues and ensure quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need for Code Quality in Plugins</strong>: Marius and Niels discuss the importance of evaluating the quality of third-party plugins, considering both technical factors like coding standards and softer factors like update frequency and developer commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration Between CTOs and CEOs</strong>: For agencies, having a clear vision and communication between technical and business leadership is vital for growing innovation while maintaining business goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariusvetrici/\">Marius on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielsdeblaauw/\">Niels on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://level-level.com/\">Level Level</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpriders.com/\">WPRiders</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wppluginreview.com/\">WPPluginReview (coming soon as of August 22, 2024)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://phpstan.org/\">PHPStan</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 09:11:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Jamie Marsland Joins Automattic as Head of WordPress YouTube\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=159788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/jamie-marsland-joins-automattic-as-head-of-wordpress-youtube\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4339:\"<p>Jamie Marsland, a well-known figure in the WordPress community, has officially joined Automattic as the Head of WordPress.org YouTube.

He is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Pootlepress</a>, a leading WordPress development company known for products such as Gutenberg Pro, WooBuilder Blocks, Storefront Blocks, and WooHoo Bar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, he took the WordPress world by storm with his <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/speed-build-challenge/\">WordPress Speed Build Challenge</a>, in which participants have 30 minutes to recreate a famous website using WordPress. He successfully roped in celebrities like Ben Ritner (Founder of Kadence Theme), Justin Tadlock (Developer Relations Wrangler at Automattic), Brian Gardner (WordPress advocate at WP Engine), Nick Diego (Developer Relations Advocate at Automattic), Rich Tabor (Product Manager at Automattic), Jonathan Jernigan (Owner and founder at APEX Web Solutions) and Jessica Lyschik (Frontend and WordPress developer at Greyd)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach to engaging the WordPress community has been a breath of fresh air, especially for a platform that has historically shied away from heavy marketing.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how automation can be used to monitor accessibility related tasks for your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WP wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Blake Bertuccelli-Booth. Blake has been in the world of web design for over a decade, a journey that eventually led him to become an advocate for web accessibility. He&#8217;s the founder of Equalify, a company dedicated to enhancing accessibility across open source platforms, particularly within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His passion for this cause was kindled through his experiences working with higher education organizations, where he saw firsthand the challenges faced by users reliant on assistive technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we get into a tool Blake&#8217;s been working on. It&#8217;s specifically designed to crawl websites and identify accessibility issues. This tool has been used to survey over 120,000 pages across wordpress.org properties, and has revealed over 2.1 million accessibility issues, shedding light on the pervasive nature of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the challenges of defining accessibility and why existing guidelines often fall short. Blake emphasizes the moral imperative of web accessibility highlighting the real world impact of individual&#8217;s lives and stressing the importance of education for developers and designers. He argues that accessible design isn&#8217;t just about adhering to regulations, but about alleviating, suffering and enhancing the online experience for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conversation also touches on the increasing prominence of web accessibility and the potential ramifications of upcoming legislation like the European Accessibility Act. Blake discusses his personal struggles with dyslexia, underscoring how properly formatted content can be a source of profound relief and empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also highlight the collaborative spirit of the WordPress community in tackling accessibility concerns, and Blake extends an open invitation for all to join in with his efforts. He provides insights into practical steps, such as reviewing automated violations and developing tickets to contribute to this collective mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re passionate about web accessibility or eager to learn how your work can make a tangible difference in people&#8217;s lives, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Blake Bertuccelli-Booth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Blake Bertuccelli-Booth. Hello Blake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:58] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> Hello. How you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, really nice to chat to you today. We&#8217;re going to talk about the subject of accessibility, and Blake has got some really interesting data that he&#8217;s going to share with us. So it won&#8217;t be the normal conversation about accessibility, but I&#8217;m imagining that we&#8217;ll stray into those, in air quotes, normal bits and pieces as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we begin Blake, if you are going to be talking about accessibility, I guess we need to know that you know what you are talking about, that you have authority. So I&#8217;m going to give you an opportunity to give us your bio, and maybe in that bio, just paint a picture of what it is that interests you about accessibility, and what your posture is about it, and what you&#8217;ve done in the past related to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> Well, I started web designing over a decade ago. It was how I was paying my way through college. Every piece along the way of me designing websites, was me trying to figure out how to communicate a client&#8217;s vision to the user they wanted. And this was all WordPress hacking and developing themes, or plugins that helped communicate a client&#8217;s vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And along the way, I was also working with a lot of higher ed organisations, and before I heard accessibility from anyone else, I heard it from folks who worked at higher ed organisations. And they kept telling me, you should really care about this. And it was the thing that, admittedly, I thought about, I looked into a little bit, but I didn&#8217;t really bring to the forefront of my mind. And that started to switch as I started to meet users who relied on screen reading technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular project that I was working on for a higher ed organisation, brought in users to come and use the websites that we were creating. And these users use what&#8217;s called a screen reader. So if you don&#8217;t have access to a monitor, you can&#8217;t see a monitor because you&#8217;re blind, or you have low vision, you use a screen reader, which basically reads what&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when this first user used my website on their screen reader, it was god awful. They couldn&#8217;t find anything, they couldn&#8217;t find any headers or anything like that. And watching this user use the website, it immediately clicked that I have to really understand this. And this was about, I don&#8217;t know, six or seven years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from there, I started baking accessibility into a lot of the work that we did. And it just became a piece, while I was doing client work, that I was thinking about constantly, and usually letting the clients tell me, we don&#8217;t want it to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And flash forward to about two years ago, when I was able to leave my web development company that I started, and just focus on what I wanted to focus on. And when I was thinking through the skills that I built up and my interests, my personal interests, it all came down to web accessibility. Because this was a place that I could really lend my expertise of being a web developer, designer for many years, and someone who is very passionate about access to information and the community that&#8217;s built out of open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve built a company called Equalify, about two years ago, and we&#8217;re really heavily focused on building a better web accessibility platform, that really has accessibility at its heart. We&#8217;re very focused on being open source, and we really want to support the open source community like WordPress. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here today, to help the community, and bring it along into an accessible future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like there was a nice bit of serendipity in terms of the timing, because you&#8217;re interested in a subject which, honestly, five years ago, I think not many people were talking about. It was a pretty edge case thing. But now, fast forward, we&#8217;re in June, late June 2024 that we&#8217;re recording this, and it genuinely is the topic of this year I think. Maybe there&#8217;s a couple of others, you know, there&#8217;s a couple of things that still hang on, like SEO, and what have you, but it&#8217;s right up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You go to WordPress events, and there&#8217;s always a talk about accessibility. And so this has now become what you do for a living. And I&#8217;m curious what your position is in terms of whether or not the skillset that you&#8217;ve got is possible for a, let&#8217;s say a freelancer. Let&#8217;s just pick somebody who&#8217;s building websites for a client, and they&#8217;ve got multiple clients to manage, they&#8217;re building a website with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you say it&#8217;s possible for that individual to learn enough or is it more a case of, go out and find somebody like Equalify, find an organisation, find an expert and hire them out as a third party, if you like, to look at the websites that you are building? Is there too much to know, along with all the other things that you&#8217;ve got to know in the stack of being a freelance website builder, or is it possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:41] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> Web accessibility is one of the most accessible, technical skills that you can grab. So there is a set of guidelines called the WCAG, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines are a little bit technical and difficult to read, but they boil down to basic concepts that you can, that anybody can really figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of it has to do with how you&#8217;re structuring your page. What those HTML things like H1, H2, H3 are for. You&#8217;re not really learning advanced skills, you&#8217;re more learning what the purpose of some of the early HTML pieces were. And you don&#8217;t need to be an expert at web accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say, my role a lot of times is scanning giant, humongous networks because I don&#8217;t think, if I was just hired to be a website accessibility expert, and work on five or six page websites like I did as a designer, I wouldn&#8217;t really have a job because it&#8217;s a pretty simple discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the larger scope pieces are really where my job comes in, where I&#8217;m scanning hundreds of thousands of pages, and looking at larger trends and finding interesting ways to interpret data, and create a culture of accessibility in large organisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Kind of fascinating that that job does exist now, and that you can make a career out of that. And I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;s many prongs to that. And I&#8217;m thinking in terms of things like the European Accessibility Act, which is coming down the pike fairly soon. And we could get into that, and the dates that all of that is going to be happening, but that&#8217;s a bit of a stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there&#8217;s legislation coming around which is going to compel websites, certain websites, and there are caveats around which websites are in, and which websites are out, if you know what I mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also the kind of, the moral argument that everybody seems to be having now, that it&#8217;s just the right thing to do. Before we hit record, we were talking about how your father had been a big advocate for changing the physical landscape of where he lived, for putting in ramps so that people could access doors easily and what have you. And all of that is really easy for me to see. It&#8217;s so straightforward. Look, there&#8217;s somebody in a wheelchair, and they cannot get through that door. That needs fixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on the web, I feel that most of it is disguised from people like me. I am able to use my eyes perfectly well. I wear glasses. My ears function. I have both hands, and my legs work. So basically what I&#8217;m trying to say is, when I go to a website, I&#8217;m using a mouse, I&#8217;m using a keyboard, I can listen to the videos and all of that. I don&#8217;t have any problems, so it&#8217;s disguised, so it does take somebody with that expertise like you to point it out, I feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even though the WCAG guidelines are there for everybody to read, it&#8217;s very easy to just say, I don&#8217;t know what that is, I can&#8217;t see it, it&#8217;s not a problem for me. But it does feel like the moral argument is becoming louder and louder, people are talking about it more. But also the stick that we mentioned. And I&#8217;m thinking of the European Accessibility Act, I don&#8217;t know if any similar legislation is coming down in the part of the world where you live, North America. But yeah, we seem to be on the precipice of some big change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s two points that I think you&#8217;ve really hit the nail on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is the moral kind of argument around this. When you are witnessing a person who is suffering, whether it&#8217;s because they can&#8217;t navigate Facebook on their screen reader, or because they&#8217;ve just tripped and fallen and broke in their leg, you want to do something to help. And that is a moral impulse that I feel, and it&#8217;s a really cool impulse that I can work with in my profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what I&#8217;ve discovered, in becoming more and more in tune with accessibility rules and regulation, is that you really shouldn&#8217;t focus on the rules and regulation aspect. You should focus on that moral impulse. And you should try to educate developers and designers on these issues because of how they affect other human beings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m really big into philosophy, and there&#8217;s a classic equation that got me really focused into accessibility. It&#8217;s the idea that, if you saw someone in distress, if a child fell in a pond in front of you and they were, needed help, you would definitely go jump in. But if you could pay $25, $50 to buy a bed net to prevent mosquitoes in Africa, that would be more of a decision to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I see the accessibility equation in that same kind of moral framework, where, though I am not using a screen reader myself, or using eye tracking software myself, and though my friends aren&#8217;t around me. I know that my work is contributing to alleviating other people&#8217;s suffering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that I&#8217;ve become more of an accessibility advocate, and have met folks that have agonized over navigating their bank statements, for instance, or applying for vital needs. I know that every day that I spend on this accessibility problem, I am doing good for others in the world. And I just have not found anything in web design or web development that gets me to that point of doing moral good day in, day out. And that&#8217;s what keeps me working hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The word which is popping into my head is meaningful. You&#8217;ve given yourself a meaningful reason to build websites. If profit was the thing that you were after, maybe you would derive some meaning from that, but I think most people, when they examine life, they kinda quickly work out that profit is interesting, but it doesn&#8217;t really provide all that much meaning. Where, it sounds very much like this really does, on some very basic level, very core level in your being, it provides you with that sense of purpose and meaningfulness, which is really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another intuition that I just had, whilst you were talking was, using the example of the person in the wheelchair who cannot access the restaurant because the door is slightly above, and there&#8217;s no ramp and what have you. The crowd gather round, and in the real world you witness that, and you see it, and everybody&#8217;s taken aback. Hang on, that&#8217;s wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the internet is very often a fairly solitary thing. You know, you&#8217;d be sitting in a room, perhaps by yourself, you might be, I don&#8217;t know, on a couch, browsing on an iPad, or an iPhone, or something like that. But broadly speaking, you&#8217;re doing it by yourself. And so there&#8217;s never that sense of crowd watching and gathering that kind of moral outrage, that, whoa, hang on, this isn&#8217;t right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, if you can&#8217;t access the web, because the web is the thing that you simply can&#8217;t access because it&#8217;s broken in some way, where do you even go to report this kind of stuff? How do you begin to say to a website owner, hang on, your website isn&#8217;t working because I can&#8217;t find the phone number, with the technology that I have, my screen reader, I can&#8217;t find the phone number on your website to report it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s all these strange things which somebody like me in the world, walking around, I can see the wheelchair problem, but I&#8217;m not encountering the accessibility problems because, A, I don&#8217;t experience them myself, B, it&#8217;s probably fairly solitary and, C, it&#8217;s probably really difficult for these people to have a voice because the technology itself is kind of like a gatekeeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:00] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> That&#8217;s a really important note. You know, I haven&#8217;t really thought of it as like, the web is solitary and so that you&#8217;re not seeing the person struggle. And also, people are very polite in this world. My friends who use screen readers are amazingly polite, even though they&#8217;re sometimes called out as trolls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a really good friend who I went to a conference with, and we were staying in the same hotel room, and I happened to be in the bathroom, he didn&#8217;t know I was in there taking a shower. I heard from the other room a string of curses, like it just went on this tangent. And I came out and I said, Kevin, what&#8217;s wrong? And he, his job, he had to use Facebook for a task in his job, and Facebook just wasn&#8217;t accessible to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They kept saying things to him, and it started to aggravate him in such a way. And like that aggravation, he&#8217;s never shown before. He is a very sweet person. I, you know, wanted to say like, I want to record you and bring this to the forefront of the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem though with that, and this is something that I see a lot, is that, people who do raise the flags online, and they can do it in a very non-judgmental way, are immediately degraded to the place of trolls. So we have this culture online of trolls, and I see it again and again, where there are very justified comments to a website&#8217;s accessibility. And those comments are completely unanswered, in a way that, if someone was in a room expressing these comments to a group of others, they would be completely heard and really taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve heard this from my friends who do rely on assistive technology, they don&#8217;t want to speak up anymore because they&#8217;ve had a few experiences of being completely silenced, because they&#8217;re put in a place of trolls, because they&#8217;re put in a place of a complainer. When they&#8217;re just saying, we can&#8217;t access this website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And you can imagine, in my scenario, if I went into a shop, only to discover that every single item was on shelves 30 feet in the air, and there was no ladders available. Well, carry on, honestly do your shopping. What&#8217;s the problem? Look, everything&#8217;s there, I can see it all. Just get it into the cart and go and check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outrage would be almost instantaneous. But the majority, and I think we&#8217;re going to talk about this 80, 20 split, and concentrate on the 20. I think that 20% is maybe not in conversation with the majority of people. And you are in a position where you see this more, and so you probably have a sense of that outrage, and a sense of that injustice, whereas, I imagine the people who are building websites typically, perhaps don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s that empathic journey that you&#8217;ve got to go on. You&#8217;ve got to educate yourself, you&#8217;ve got to expose yourself to people who have these things. I don&#8217;t know, maybe that&#8217;s through YouTube videos, or listening to podcasts like this. But you have to go through something where you feel a sense of moral outrage, for want of a better word. Maybe that&#8217;s too strong a term, but you get the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sense of moral injustice, and that something needs to be done. And if you&#8217;ve never been through that, it may be hard to understand what&#8217;s going on. So maybe we need to talk about what you&#8217;ve just talked about, the whole troll thing and what have you. Anyway, there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:04] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> It&#8217;s very exciting to see when someone starts to care about accessibility, because it does click in a person&#8217;s mind, like a developer, designer&#8217;s mind, in a way that it goes beyond learning a new technical craft. And it does, to bring it back to morality, it does strike something deep, where like, oh, the way that I use headings will make somebody&#8217;s life better. And of course, I want to make somebody&#8217;s life better. It&#8217;s easy for me to use headings this way, I can use a heading instead of a div, or these type of really easy things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it becomes so ingrained in the work that they do every day, that the work they do gains purpose. And this is something that I find really exciting about talking to lots of different developers and designers. And usually what happens is, it&#8217;s a developer, designer who&#8217;s doing it for many years like myself, and it&#8217;s just, I don&#8217;t want to design another website, I feel like this is pixel pushing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I start to talk about accessibility, or when someone who I work with who uses screen readers comes and shows a demo, and they show like how the work that you do can impact the life of someone, and how big the problem is. All of a sudden the work of the designer and developer has amazing meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a call to action for any designer, developer that&#8217;s just like, oh, this is just work to me. Look into accessibility. Meet somebody who uses assistive technology, because your work can actually mean something to people in a very, very big way. And it&#8217;s very exciting to see when that happens because, like myself, I&#8217;ve seen others who&#8217;ve gone from, I want to start a farm and never look at a computer again. To, this is really vital, and now every day I wake up and I look at the numbers of websites that I&#8217;ve fixed and issues that I fixed, and I see how that&#8217;s affecting people every single day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m about to say something, and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll hit the target, or if it&#8217;ll land correctly, but I&#8217;m going to try, and that is to say that, life is already difficult enough for people who have accessibility needs. The world is already, I imagine, a little bit harder to manage in certain respects, and obviously there&#8217;s a whole spectrum of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the internet offered this fabulous promise of kind of the world brought into your hand, or onto your desktop, or what have you. And so it kind of feels like a one, two punch really. If you have accessibility needs, that the very thing which promised so much is, well, not taken away from you because it was never there for you, but it&#8217;s not provided for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is hard enough. Here&#8217;s this fabulous thing, the internet, which could have made life so much easier, and yet it never was that easy for you. So it feels like that&#8217;s a double punch. Does that make sense? Have I overstated that a little bit? Did I go in the wrong direction?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:58] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> No, I think that, I have dyslexia so I just confuse grammar and words, and I read a page and letters are flying around. And it does feel like a breath of fresh air when I&#8217;m looking at a page that is formatted in a more broad, large, fonted way. I feel like, oh, I can actually understand the concepts here. And it feels like a relaxation almost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I would say is like, the users that I work with, or my friends who rely on assistive technology. The bigger issue that I focus on, because they would go happily do something else, I&#8217;m thinking of my friend Jay, who&#8217;s this amazing blind fellow who loves oldie tunes he calls them, like old records and old vinyls. Usually, if he comes to a website that&#8217;s not accessible, he just shuts his computer and goes and plays music, and he doesn&#8217;t really go deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue that I see though is less of like suffering, and we should help others because they have a life of suffering, and more of a idea that knowledge should be shared. And if we want to really focus on these values that have created the internet, of transparency, of free access to information, all the core open source values, if we really believe in those, then we&#8217;re going to make sure that that 20% of the world, the over 2 billion people, have access to that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with over 94% of the million most popular homepages failing accessibility tests, to me that is failing to give people access to vital knowledge, and that failing to give the potential to unlock new knowledge. And if we&#8217;re not doing that, then I just don&#8217;t understand what we really believe in. Then we don&#8217;t actually believe in these open source principles. That we don&#8217;t actually believe in the principles of a free internet, because we are excluding people. It&#8217;s much more of a moral problem than it is the headache of these people, because there&#8217;s so many other things that folks would rather be doing than navigating an inaccessible website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I prefer your encapsulation of the argument a lot more than mine, and I thank you for sort of stepping in and saving me there. That was a much better way of describing it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Project Eudiamonia is something that you&#8217;ve been working on. This is an automated web accessibility testing suite, which you&#8217;ve developed over at Equalify. First of all, we should probably get over the, what is the word eudiamonia? Both you and I had a fun chat about this before we hit record, but it&#8217;s called Project Eudiamonia. We&#8217;re going to get into the data and the stats of that in a moment but, what&#8217;s eudiamonia? Because it&#8217;s a real word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:38] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> So eudiamonia is a challenge to ask what, well, eudiamonia is. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve used it. And the deeper kind of concept that I like behind that is that, it&#8217;s like the end fulfillment of knowledge. It&#8217;s like this ancient Greek concept that says, this is really what you should strive after, and this is why it takes work to get to this end goal of like ultimate knowledge. And it&#8217;s really fulfillment, so it is a little bit selfish. But again, I&#8217;ve used it in this kind of WordPress sense in the WordPress world, because I like to challenge people to ask questions. And I love when people ask me, what is eudiamonia? And so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called Project Eudiamonia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Ideal, and I&#8217;ve fallen right into that trap, so that&#8217;s perfect. Great. So it&#8217;s more about the data I think, the next part of this episode. And the data that you&#8217;ve presented, to me at least anyway, is all to do with the WordPress properties, so specifically .org. And you have set your tool off, maybe we should actually explain what the tool is, and then we can get into the data. So, what is the project and the tooling that you are using to capture the data that we&#8217;ll get into?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:46] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> So I&#8217;ve developed a open source accessibility platform called Equalify, and Equalify will use different rules that establish accessibility. One of the most popular ones is the Axe core rule set. And what it basically does is it scans websites against these rules. It sees how headings are used on a page, or how color is used, and then decides if a webpage passes or fails at these rules, to establish a baseline of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s really important to note that it&#8217;s not necessarily saying, you&#8217;re accessible, or you&#8217;re not accessible. It&#8217;s just saying that your page fails at certain tests around accessibility because you aren&#8217;t really, if you pass all of the tests of the best scan, you&#8217;re going to get around 40% of the issues, maybe 50%. You&#8217;re not going to get all the issues, but it&#8217;ll give you a picture of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve developed a piece of software that will scan a bunch of pages, basically it&#8217;ll crawl through, or look at a site map, and scan all of those pages. And then it will come up with a report on violations, or of rules that we scanned. And so we&#8217;ve created a framework. I like to think of it as like a WordPress for web accessibility, that we can plug in different rule sets, and we can customise our reporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for WordPress, what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve started to, keyword is started, because this is very early in our process, but we&#8217;ve started to construct a framework for how we assess accessibility within the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re starting with just .org properties. So those are like wordpress.org and all the properties around that. We&#8217;ve established around 448 properties that we&#8217;re looking at, 448 URLs that we&#8217;re looking at. And then every week I&#8217;m trying to scan new pages. So I think the last scan we had over 120,000 pages. Then we&#8217;re kind of focusing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now it&#8217;s a little bit chaotic, where we just have all of this data and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean action. But what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re taking this data, finding key patterns, and the things that the WordPress community wants to focus on, and then building out automated reporting of issues. So that when somebody, like right now, WordPress is going through a big redesign, so when somebody wants to assess the general accessibility of the thousands and thousands of pages that show different plugins in the WordPress directory, that they can quickly get a picture of that, and that the key issues can be reported automatically in GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so I&#8217;m just going to try and reprise what you just said, and if I make any mistakes just please interrupt me. So your tool is a bit like Google Bot, if you like. It goes around and it crawls, and you provide it with certain rules. Almost like the plugin architecture of WordPress, you plug in what it is that you want it to go out and look for. And at the moment you&#8217;ve trained it on the wordpress.org properties, and you found 448, I think you said, of those, of which there are about 120,000 pages that you&#8217;ve been crawling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re saying also that no system is perfect. Even if it passes every single thing that your tool could throw at it, you&#8217;re still only at about 40%. There&#8217;s still going to be 60% of errors that it won&#8217;t catch. Is that simply because of the technical limitations, the kind of things that an automated tool just cannot find at the moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:27] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> There&#8217;s a little bit of technical limitations. The bigger issue is how we define accessibility. So what I spoke about earlier, the web content accessibility guidelines, these like central guidelines. They&#8217;re not perfect and there&#8217;s a lot of gray areas, and leeway to how you define something as being accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is kind of by design because the web content accessibility guidelines, for better or for worse, are largely made for user evaluations, to build tests for users to go through and evaluate, rather than a robot tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some work, and I&#8217;m doing a lot of it, around AI and how we can start to assess technology in a little bit more of a, we can start building tests in a more complex way. But it goes back to, when you say accessibility and I say accessibility, how we define what an accessible website is. There&#8217;s not really an agreed statement of, this is what accessibility is. And, if we are going to say the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are what accessibility is, the rules aren&#8217;t good enough to have any technology, let alone any human being, understand every opportunity to break those rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Got it. Right, okay, that&#8217;s cleared that up. So even the rules themselves, around accessibility, are still in a state of flux and need to be refined. And I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s going to be, well, we have this thing in the UK called the Forth Bridge, and it&#8217;s this bridge which never gets finished being painted. They paint from one end, two years later, they get to the other end and they finish painting it, and by that point, where they started was already starting to blister and rust, so they could go back and begin again. And it&#8217;s the Forth Bridge, never ever gets finished painting. It&#8217;s like that. These guidelines will constantly be updated, new devices will come out, new HTML specs, and things will come out, and upset the apple carts. So it&#8217;s a never ending kind of carousel of things going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:21] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> And I would say that we shouldn&#8217;t expect that any accessibility guidelines, or anything around technology ever came to some kind of golden truth, because that&#8217;s not actually even good in my mind, because you are squashing innovation in this space, and innovation is really central to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard so much critique around, well, like we don&#8217;t even know what accessibility is because it&#8217;s changing all the time. But like devices are changing, and the HTML spec that you mentioned is changing, and CSS is changing. Those changes, while it&#8217;s a pain when you&#8217;re a developer and you have to learn something new all the time, it actually is furthering our world because we&#8217;re getting a lot more new technology that&#8217;s doing amazing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My critique of the rule set is really that it&#8217;s not changing fast enough. That we should have much quicker changes, and it should be rapid. I think the 2.2 version was introduced not too long ago, or officially adopted not too long ago. And like 3.0 is kind of on the radar. It will be adopted, there&#8217;s not like a firm date set, but that&#8217;s deplorable. We should have new rule sets with at least the regularity that a new WordPress releases. I don&#8217;t understand why we can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s where I put my stake in the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you. So you&#8217;ve decided to go into the .org project and, is there a reason why you did that? Because obviously you&#8217;ve got a business, you could be doing this for clients. What was the theory behind that? I don&#8217;t want to put words into your mouth. Why pick .org and go at it? And we&#8217;ll get into the data in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:55] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> I can&#8217;t ignore WordPress, and that is really the biggest reason why I feel like we have to focus on it. Over 40% of the internet is run on WordPress. And when I have dabbled in other CMS worlds, or open source worlds, it doesn&#8217;t feel as impactful to work on those projects as it does with WordPress every single day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other kind of main piece is, I really love the people working on accessibility in the WordPress community. I love Joe, I love Alex, I love Amber. They&#8217;re great people, and it&#8217;s really been fun to meet them and hang out with them. When you&#8217;re part of an open source community, I&#8217;ve found you really should like the people who you&#8217;re talking with, and like that ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s impact the people of the community, and the third and final piece, I think WordPress is a amazingly human centered technology. And when you blog, you&#8217;re having to deal with all sorts of amazing creative forces, and accessibility lends itself so well to that human-centric economy and technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that we have not really tapped into that as much as we can. And so there is an amazing potential to activate, not only the contributors to the WordPress Core project, but to every user that uses WordPress. Because they are subscribing to something that says, we value human creativity, we value your kind of weirdness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, interesting. So the numbers themselves though, we alluded to the fact that you found 448 .org properties, 125,000 pages. Now here&#8217;s the big numbers, I guess. The identified violations, and I&#8217;m just reading these off the show notes and you can add some context to these in a moment, just over 2.1 million, which seems like quite a large number. But then you break that down into something a bit more manageable I think, 1.13, so 1,135 issues, so it looks like many of those issues repeat multiple, hundreds, thousands of times. And that makes it a little bit easier to parse I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just tell us what this all breaks down to. Is it that wordpress.org has just done a really bad job, hasn&#8217;t kept up with the time? Is it simply that there&#8217;s just so much out there, you know, 125,000 pages, that&#8217;s not easy to fix quickly? What&#8217;s your takeaway from all of that data?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:26] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> So, of the millions of pages that Equalify has scanned, we&#8217;ve seen around 40 issues per page. And this is not just WordPress, this is like all the pages that we&#8217;ve scanned on the internet that our clients, or that we&#8217;ve done ourselves. And then also the typical kind of web accessibility credo is that you get around 50 issues per page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the way these numbers break down is that it&#8217;s pretty average. It&#8217;s not anything beyond the blue. It just looks like these .org properties just haven&#8217;t been super paying attention to the accessibility, but they&#8217;re not doing things that are like actively trying to thwart accessibility, so it&#8217;s not that bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So 2,112,224 violations is one of the last scans we did. These big numbers are really good because what these big numbers are saying is they&#8217;re basically capturing all the little HTML nodes, all the pieces of HTML that are failing the test. And then what you could do with these 2 million plus pieces of HTML is you can then see, okay, they&#8217;re patterns. Oh, look, this one plugin is creating this piece of HTML, and that piece kind of comes over, and over, and over again. And that&#8217;s when you can start to do really impactful things with very little work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am like most developers, where I want to be really lazy about my work, and I want to do something that is extremely impactful with as little work as possible. And so, like the other day, I think I found like something that 80,000 violations would be solved by fixing just like a small labeling of a navigation element.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what I&#8217;m hoping, and what I&#8217;ve seen in other communities is that, when you attribute these big numbers to issues, and then you actually have a really quick way of fixing these big numbers, that it motivates people to do the work, even though it&#8217;s a very small bit of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m testing that within the WordPress community. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to work. I don&#8217;t know if these big numbers are going to actually discourage work. We&#8217;ll see. Right now, it&#8217;s kind of at the point where it&#8217;s all a test. Maybe WordPress contributors like thumbs up emojis instead of numbers of violations they fixed. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is the idea then, from the data that you&#8217;ve gathered, to point it out to the community, blog posts, podcasts, things like this, and then hope to establish some sort of feedback loop. Where the people who can therefore change it, and that could be you obviously, as well as a whole bunch of other people, they become interested in this? They come and seek your data, and I&#8217;m guessing that you&#8217;re updating the data on a fairly regular basis. This wasn&#8217;t a crawl that you did back in 2023, and that was it, you&#8217;re constantly going through this. And that you set up what&#8217;s some kind of, like I said, feedback loop, channel of communication, team within WordPress that you can drop into. What&#8217;s the intended goal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> We have, in the Slack and the WordPress, Make WordPress Slack, we have an accessibility testing channel. And what I&#8217;ve started to see is now other teams working within WordPress, specifically on the .org, and now more specifically on the redesign, will ping me when they have something new and they want it to be tested, and I&#8217;ll go in and test it. My goal is to get automated accessibility testing into the culture of WordPress development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re starting with .org properties. I think it&#8217;s very realistic to say that we can make .org very accessible. And I was just guarded with my language because I was talking about how accessibility can&#8217;t really be defined, but like we can make it very accessible, a triumph of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, once we make .org properties a triumph of accessibility, I think then we move, and we figured out how to work within the community. Then we move into the bigger thing, which is Core. And we figure out how Core can make all of the internet accessible, and how we can make Core as well accessible because there&#8217;s a lot of problems in that, but we&#8217;re not touching those yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can people use the Equalify tool that you&#8217;ve been using? Is it possible for people to download this? I can&#8217;t remember what you said at the top of the show, whether it was an open source piece of software, or what have you. If that&#8217;s the case, can people then do that, join the Slack team and what have you, and report back? I&#8217;m going to guess that the answer to my next question is no. Here&#8217;s the question. Are you inundated with volunteers wishing to help you do this, to the point where you are turning people away?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:49] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> There needs to be more volunteers helping this project out. There are really easy lifts that we need volunteers helping with. So like one of the main things is looking at some of the automated violations that are reported, and just making sure they make sense. That requires some accessibility knowledge, but it&#8217;s nothing that I wouldn&#8217;t help someone with, or the accessibility team of WordPress wouldn&#8217;t help somebody with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another way, if you don&#8217;t know anything about accessibility, that you could help, if you have some kind of technical background, and that&#8217;s looking at tickets that were developed. We&#8217;re developing tickets based off of these violations with some large language model help. And we are not going to actually publish anything that hasn&#8217;t been reviewed by at least one person, probably two people, because every time we look at these tickets, they look very good, but when you start to dig into the HTML, it doesn&#8217;t actually help that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we really need help reviewing these tickets that are created by the large language models. And I think that&#8217;s a great way to also get involved, because you don&#8217;t have to be an accessibility expert. You have to just have common sense, and ask questions when you don&#8217;t know and something seems fishy, and just help with this process. So we really need help with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Best place to go? Would that be to direct people towards the accessibility-text Slack channel? Is that the single best place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:12] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> Accessibility-testing, or accessibility Slack channel, yes. I&#8217;m active in the accessibility-testing channel. We have a meeting every Wednesday at 15:15 UTC, I&#8217;m always there. But the accessibility Slack channel is also really good. You can jump in there. Joe is there, I&#8217;m there sometimes as well. And so feel free to jump in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re also at GitHub. You can look us up at github.com/equalifyeverything. And there you can get into the whole world of Equalify. And you asked earlier about downloading or using the software that we&#8217;re using. Yes, you can start using it right now, with the caveat that you have to be a little bit technical. You have to know how to use node and things like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll eventually get as easy as WordPress&#8217;s one click install, but we&#8217;re not there yet because our focus is scanning and fixing. We don&#8217;t have enough people to help with the one click install. We will get there one day, and it will be just a one click install. Mark my word, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Equalify has also donated our entire managed service to WordPress. We have literally said, you have it for free. We&#8217;ll do as many scans as you want, we&#8217;ll do anything you want, it&#8217;s yours. And so what we&#8217;re doing, right now people can ping me and I will happily do any scans they want, and get any reports they want. Pretty soon though, we&#8217;re going to incorporate an API that anybody in the WordPress community, and hopefully we&#8217;ll figure out how to get it so that anybody with a WordPress username can run these scans on their own WordPress related projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will have to be WordPress related projects, so it will have to be one of the properties, or maybe even Core. But that, we&#8217;re giving like what we give to larger organisations for cost, we&#8217;re giving to the entire WordPress community totally for free. And anybody can get in touch with me if they&#8217;re working on a WordPress project and want to be scanned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess if in the year 2024, if we&#8217;re offering up WordPress as a credible CMS for all of the things that the year 2024 requires of the internet, then the .org properties being a shining light of that seems a bit of a no brainer. Having those properties in tip top shape seems like a really good idea. So Blake&#8217;s available. He would like your help. He&#8217;s offered his tools up for free. Blake, where would we find you personally? Where&#8217;s the best places to reach you if this podcast episode has made people interested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:39] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> I am pretty much everywhere the internet runs. I&#8217;ve been more active on X, formerly known as Twitter, lately, and that&#8217;s B-B-E-R-T-U-C-C. That&#8217;s kind of my unfiltered me, and a good place to get in contact with me. I&#8217;m also elblakeo31 in the WordPress community. Don&#8217;t hold me against that, that name, that was when I was 14 or so, put it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if anybody wants to email me or get in touch, Blake, B-L-A-K-E. @decubing, D-E-C-U-B-I-N-G.com. They can do that. So X, B-B-E-R-T-U-C-C. WordPress elblakeo31. Or email blake@decubing.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect. Thank you very much. Blake, what an interesting project. What a moral project. Let us all hope that in the years to come, 2025, 2026, we are, all of us, reaching a near state of Eudiamonia. Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice? Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:34] <strong>Blake Bertuccelli-Booth:</strong> I love that. Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/bbertucc\">Blake Bertuccelli-Booth</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blake has been in the world of web design for over a decade, a journey that eventually led him to become an advocate for web accessibility. He is the founder of Equalify, a company dedicated to enhancing accessibility across open-source platforms, particularly within the WordPress community. His passion for this cause was kindled through his experiences working with higher education organisations, where he saw firsthand the challenges faced by users reliant on assistive technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode we get into a tool Blake’s been working on. It’s specifically designed to crawl websites and identify accessibility issues. This tool has been used to survey over 120,000 pages across wordpress.org properties, and has revealed over 2.1 million accessibility issues, shedding light on the pervasive nature of accessibility</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the challenges of defining accessibility and why existing guidelines often fall short. Blake emphasises the moral imperative of web accessibility, highlighting the real-world impact on individuals&#8217; lives and stressing the importance of education for developers and designers. He argues that accessible design isn&#8217;t just about adhering to regulations, but about alleviating suffering and enhancing the online experience for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conversation also touches on the increasing prominence of web accessibility, and the potential ramifications of upcoming legislation like the European Accessibility Act. Blake discusses his personal struggles with dyslexia, underscoring how properly formatted content can be a source of profound relief and empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also highlight the collaborative spirit of the WordPress community in tackling accessibility concerns and Blake extends an open invitation for all to join in with his efforts.

I&#8217;m Abha Thakor, your host for today&#8217;s show, which is part of our series to support your WordPress learning journey and encourage you more into WooCommerce. I&#8217;m joined today by Laura Adamonis, Nick Diego, and Kathryn Presner. Welcome. Our contributors today are people that you may have met in other places like me. They all contribute to the WordPress training team. If you haven&#8217;t heard about that yet, you&#8217;ll want to join it by the end of the show. We have some new developments to share with you, designed to make learning and using WordPress so much easier. If you&#8217;re a beginner or intermediate WordPress user, or simply would like a refresher on discovering new features, then today&#8217;s panel will be able to help. Today, the panel is representing contributors who&#8217;ve worked on the free, open-source resource learn.wordpress.org, which first went live in 2000 contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest piece of work, which includes a completely refreshed website, has come from across the world, including New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. This latest project also builds on the cross-team and multidisciplinary working that learn.wordpress.org has been fostering since its original launch. We&#8217;ve now got progressive and user-friendly learning pathways, all tailored to different types of learners and different levels. We&#8217;re going to go, first of all, to Kathryn, who&#8217;s based in Canada, and she&#8217;s going to tell us a little bit more about why these learning pathways are so important and, more importantly, how you can use them. Over to you, Kathryn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Hey, thank you. I am super excited to share what learning pathways are and how they&#8217;re going to help people with their WordPress journeys. The idea is that we have these learning pathways geared to different types of folks working with WordPress. Right now, we have pathways for users, people who run their own site or run a site for an organization or a company. And we&#8217;ve got other pathways for developers, people who work with the code side of WordPress, and in the future, we&#8217;ll also have pathways for designers and contributors. The idea is that within each of these pathways, you will have specific courses for people at the beginner level, people at an intermediate level, and people at an advanced level. So you can jump in depending on your area of interest and where you are in the WordPress world and take a journey. If you&#8217;re starting from scratch, you could start at the beginner level. If you&#8217;re more intermediate, you can jump into one of those courses and follow step-by-step, walking you through all the key things to learn in that area. So if you want, I can give you an example of one of the specific learning pathways, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />That would be great, Kathryn. Do talk us through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Sure. One of the popular pathways so far is beginner WordPress user. This is something that is super useful for anyone who&#8217;s just starting out with WordPress and wants to create their own site. Or, for example, let&#8217;s say you start working at an organization, and part of your duties at that organization is to manage the site that the organization has, and you&#8217;ve never worked with WordPress before. You can dive into this course, and it&#8217;s divided into different sections called modules. You can get started learning about the basics of WordPress, everything from how to install a theme, what is a plugin, familiarizing yourself with the WordPress interface, understanding what to do, the basics of WP admin, using the media library, the basics of site editing, and the basics of content creation. There&#8217;s even a section introducing security, spam, and backups, and SEO. These are things that we don&#8217;t go into in depth in the beginner course, but it gives you a taste of each thing and provides a good basis for getting started. From there, you can move on and dive even deeper into some of those topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It is a really comprehensive guide, and I think for anybody wanting to start off with WordPress, that new beginner pathway really does work. But, of course, like most things on learn.wordpress.org, and in fact the whole WordPress.org project, they are things that we can build on. They are what the community has asked for, but more importantly, they are made by the community for the community. The learning pathways also build on the work with the Individual Learner survey, which was led by Wes and I last year, and we featured that previously on Do the Woo. More importantly, we are very grateful for all the help we had with getting feedback through our Do the Woo audience. The demand has shown that people want goal-oriented learning that could be segmented by roles and skill levels. It also showed the need for that one-stop, trusted source where users can augment, refresh, and have a clear pathway through to other learning or to more in-depth WordPress learning. I&#8217;m going to go to you now, Nick. As a developer relations advocate and also from your other work and contributions to things like the developer blog in WordPress, how do you think the refreshed Learn WordPress site really addresses these needs? How does it provide that one-stop shop which can be trusted?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, so I think that previously, or even today, there&#8217;s so much information out on the web on how to learn to use WordPress, whether you&#8217;re a developer or a user, and you search into Google, and you can find all sorts of resources. The redesign and restructuring of Learn WordPress provide a source of learning information that&#8217;s being built by contributors to WordPress that ideally is going to be the most up-to-date, most comprehensive. This is the place that you can send people to learn whether you&#8217;re a user or developer. A lot of my work focuses on improving developer documentation and also, as you mentioned, writing tutorials and guides on the developer blog. What we&#8217;re going to start to see is a much tighter connection between those resources and Learn because they both should go hand in hand. The Learn resources reference the documentation, and the documentation can then reference the courses that developers can follow if they&#8217;d like a more structured learning environment. I&#8217;m really excited to see that close connection as we move forward because we&#8217;re seeing such a great improvement with Learn, and we&#8217;re also seeing a lot of improvement with documentation as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />So, are there any losses with this site, Nick? Will people still be able to join online workshops or have a way of learning together with other people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Absolutely. I think that there are many different ways that folks learn. One of the contributions that I do quite a bit is a series called Developer Hours, where we have these online learning workshops where people come and learn about a specific topic. But again, those topics in that live environment are going to reference documentation and Learn courses. So, it&#8217;s kind of like this nice big collection of different ways that people can learn, but they all feed off one another and support one another as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And I guess that&#8217;s one of the highlights—not just about where the project is at the moment, but also how, as a community, we&#8217;ve grown to the extent that all that crosswork really can happen, does happen, and we can continue to build on it. That takes me over to Laura. Laura, you&#8217;re one of the current team reps for the training team. Just share what the training team does for people who are not familiar and are listening today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />So, the training team is the bones of the Learn WordPress learning materials. We are the creators, the teachers, the editors, the reviewers, and the researchers that pull all the information together to provide a lesson or an online workshop so that we can present the material to our beginners, our intermediates, and we&#8217;re looking for some advanced people too. We don&#8217;t have as many in that realm, but it&#8217;s great to have a group that works together to pull these resources for learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thanks, Laura. With this current site, because it&#8217;s had lots of work done to it on Learning Pathways, which we&#8217;re going to talk more about in a few moments as well, what are the key wins for the user in terms of search?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m super excited about that because I&#8217;ve only been using WordPress for two and a half years. I&#8217;m still in the beginner stage, I feel like, and that was one of the things that I&#8217;m excited about—the navigation and search. To be able to go in and search up the word &#8220;style book,&#8221; which is still new to people, I searched that up earlier, and there are four or five different things that popped up lesson-wise that you can do individually or, like Kathryn said, as part of the learning pathway course. So that&#8217;s a definite improvement. There are still some things that we can improve upon for filtering, but I&#8217;m so happy to see that we&#8217;re heading in the right direction for the search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And of course, there&#8217;s lots of opportunities for people to help with that, isn&#8217;t there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Oh, definitely. Yes, please come help us. For any amount of time—an hour a week can make a big difference—whether fixing a bug or finding something that just doesn&#8217;t work. Just testing the site for us and filling out a feedback form is a great help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And we&#8217;re going to have some of these links in the show notes as part of your learning journey here on Do the Woo. If you want to get started, we&#8217;ll be able to signpost you to ways to do that. I&#8217;m going to jump back to Nick for a moment. Nick, in terms of the new, refreshed site, is it now easier to pop into a course or module on a mobile device?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />That&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a good question. Yeah, so the redesign of the site—part of the work done there was to standardize the underlying architecture to work off of a block theme. So all the improvements that we&#8217;re seeing in WordPress, that are being developed with each new release, this website will now be able to take advantage of those things. Previously, it was not a block theme, so I want to say yes, it is a much better mobile experience, but it will also get better as WordPress improves. Previously, it was not a block theme; it wasn&#8217;t taking advantage of some of those improvements. So, it&#8217;s an architecture that is great, and we all love the redesign and how far we&#8217;ve gotten here, but this is really only the beginning because it&#8217;s a much more solid framework with which to add more functionality, build more things in the future, and optimize various aspects. So, I&#8217;m very excited about where we can go from here, given the architectural improvements that have been done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />That&#8217;s great, Nick. And do you think that because it&#8217;s a block theme, it&#8217;s a great way for people to actually learn or be introduced to that kind of block, particularly those who want to start a WooCommerce shop and don&#8217;t really know about categories and things like that? Would you signpost this as a way of understanding that better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, I think so. One of the cool things is that if you&#8217;re following one of these learning pathways and learning about the query loop block, the search page and the course page, and the lesson page, they are powered by the query loop block. So you could literally open up the inspector in your browser and actually see that block markup that you&#8217;re learning about in these courses. Now, the query loop block is also used in WooCommerce and things like that. I think that because the theme is built with blocks and you&#8217;re learning about building with blocks, there&#8217;s a nice harmony there. Furthermore, this is an open-source project. The site, the theme that is powering the site, is open-source. So, if you are more developer-oriented, you can go to the GitHub repository and actually see how the site was architected for Learn, which I think is just another great resource to see how people are building block themes for very high-traffic sites—Learn is a very high-traffic site in the WordPress.org infrastructure. So yeah, I&#8217;m very excited about it personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />There&#8217;s nothing like deconstructing a site and being able to see how you put it all back together. And of course, with WordPress, you can play, run it on a test site, and even more so, you can join one of the numerous release parties that happen a couple of times a year, where you can test some of the new features, look at what Gutenberg is doing with the items that have been brought into core. So if you haven&#8217;t done that already, do check out some of our release podcasts, where all the links to how you can get involved with testing, how you can see what the new features are like ahead of time, and also input into them are provided. Kathryn, I&#8217;m going to delve a bit deeper now into these learning pathways. I remember when we moved from the individual learning survey to lots of charts on different platforms, looking at how the pathways would and could be created, what they should be called, how different learners approach things. Going back into the feedback, there was a lot to cover. Now I know not all the things have been implemented so far. Is there a plan for what happens next in terms of learning pathways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Well, the two imminent things that happen next are two more pathways that are going to be added. The next one in the user area is going to be advanced WordPress user. That way, we&#8217;ll have the full beginner, intermediate, and advanced user pathway complete. On the developer side, the next pathway that&#8217;s going to be worked on is intermediate plugin developer because right now, we have beginner WordPress developer, which covers the basics that any developer should know and sort of gives you the building blocks to move on to maybe specialize in theme development or plugin development. We have the intermediate theme developer pathway already created, and it was Cynthia Norman, a community member, who worked on that one. But next up will be the intermediate plugin developer pathway, and there&#8217;s actually a call for contributors for that because it&#8217;s going to be a nice, big, meaty pathway, and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of work to put it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Jonathan Bossenger from the training team has put out a specific call for folks with a development background to help put that together. And that&#8217;s actually interesting because you don&#8217;t necessarily have to do work on creating actual lessons. If you are interested in video editing, for example, you can step in and help out with editing videos that other people have created. Or maybe you&#8217;re interested in voiceovers and want to record the voiceover for one of these lessons, or maybe you want to review another lesson that someone else created. So, with that pathway that&#8217;s coming up, that&#8217;s a great opportunity for people with lots of different skills to jump in and get involved. Beyond that, in 2025, will be the next pathways in the two areas I mentioned earlier: pathways for designers and pathways for contributors who want to contribute to the project itself. That&#8217;s sort of like a meta path, if you will—not meta in the sense of the WordPress meta team, but meta in the sense of pathways about contributing to the project on any of the teams. So those are things to look out for, and if people are interested in any of those areas, that&#8217;s somewhere they could step in and get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thanks, Kathryn. I think, as we&#8217;ve said at the beginning of this show today, that we are only representing some of the very, very many contributors that have been involved even in the beginner&#8217;s cycle of this project. There&#8217;s a huge number of contributors who took part, and not all of them at the same time. One of the great things about training is that you can actually take part at different time zones. I&#8217;m just going to go over to Laura to tell us a little bit more about how people would navigate through getting involved. Where do they start? How would they actually get involved if their time zone is not the same as the meeting, particularly on the learning pathways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Okay, great. I&#8217;d be happy to point everyone in the right direction. If we go to make.wordpress.org/training, you&#8217;ll find our homepage, where we have our current focus areas. If you open up the welcome box, you&#8217;ll find the basic getting started link. We have done our own lesson on how to get started, and we walk you through setting that up. It is a self-guided onboarding program, and we also have a guided program that&#8217;s run by Kathryn. We try to match people up if they&#8217;d like to go through the guide program with a mentor. You meet with that mentor a couple of times to get one-on-one or maybe a group presentation of where to go and what you&#8217;re interested in. We do use GitHub, and sometimes that can be a little confusing. That was brand new for me, so I was a little scared about that. I didn&#8217;t want to break the site by clicking on the wrong button. So, having people within our team to walk you through is really beneficial on that aspect of it. The other part of your question was how to get involved with the learning pathways. That is really easy by going to learn.wordpress.org. As we said, the site is really clean and user-friendly now. Right at the top, in the second navigation, there&#8217;s Learning Pathways. When you click on that, you have either Develop with WordPress or Start with WordPress. You can also scroll down the page, and there&#8217;s a Get Started section that also has those two links that will start you on those two pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thanks, Laura. We can also put some of these links in our show notes, but if you&#8217;re not sure and want us to help you connect with one of these wonderful panelists today, just message us on Do the Woo. Connect with us on one of our social media channels, and we&#8217;ll be glad to signpost you and connect you to the right people. One of the things as a trainer that I&#8217;m particularly pleased to see is that we have not just a journey going in one direction—we have learning pathways that can go in multiple directions. In modern-day training, that reinforcement of learning is a key part of how lessons and learning take place outside WordPress. I&#8217;m going to go to Kathryn on this. In terms of the structure, you&#8217;ve got modules, courses, lessons, but also you&#8217;ve got the pathway at the beginning and the pathway at the end. You can also jump in and do single module refreshers. Could you share a little bit more, with some examples, of the kind of single modules that are likely to be popular or that you&#8217;ve already had feedback on as being very useful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Sure. I love the fact that everything is very accessible in terms of being able to hop in and out of a section of a course. The sections are modules, as you mentioned. For example, let&#8217;s say you are a WordPress developer, but you&#8217;ve never touched themes before—maybe you&#8217;re a plugin developer, but you&#8217;d like to get a little more understanding of WordPress themes. Well, you could jump right into Beginner WordPress Developer and go to the module on Introduction to Developing WordPress Themes. You don&#8217;t have to take the whole course because all of these sections are previewable. In other words, you don&#8217;t even have to log in. Another cool thing we did was make all these learning pathways available even before you&#8217;ve logged in. You can hop in, preview these lessons within a module like Developing WordPress Themes, or you can take the course and just do that section. In the section on Developing WordPress Themes, you&#8217;ll learn about theme structure, style sheets,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>templates, global settings, and the Create Block Theme plugin. That&#8217;s a good grounding in the basics of WordPress themes. You might say, &#8220;Hey, wow, this is really cool. Let me move right on to Intermediate Theme Development,&#8221; and you can skip everything else in the Beginner Developer pathway because you already know that stuff. That&#8217;s one possible example of how someone could hop in and use a chunk of that course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Has there been a course or a lesson or an area that has been particularly popular, and that you think people who haven&#8217;t tried WordPress before should start with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />I think the Beginner WordPress User pathway is the most popular one so far. It is one of the first ones that came out, but I think a lot of people have jumped in there. It&#8217;s just a really great area to dive in and get started if you&#8217;re completely new to WordPress because, like I mentioned before, you&#8217;re going to have sections on just a little bit of everything. It&#8217;ll give you a good grounding on how everything works. So I think that&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been very, very popular, and we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of good feedback on it so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />I think we&#8217;ll link to that as well and highlight it on our social media too. Thanks, Kathryn. Nick, I&#8217;m going to come over to you. From a beginner dev&#8217;s perspective, we&#8217;re encouraging them with releases to look at documentation, the Field Guide, to keep up with the Developer Hours that you&#8217;ve shared already, and also the developer blog. How do Learn WordPress materials really fit into that, and how can they get a joined-up sense that works for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />I think entering the WordPress space as a developer who&#8217;s never been involved with WordPress before can be quite overwhelming. There&#8217;s a lot of content, a lot of resources, a lot of different things that you can pay attention to and focus on—so much so that it can become overwhelming and may lead people to move away from WordPress or something like that. Learn provides this place where you can go, pick a learning pathway, and just follow it. As you follow it, you know you&#8217;re getting a complete overview of what the people who built the learning pathway think you need to know about WordPress development—and they did a great job of that. Once you get through that course, then you can start attending Developer Hours, diving into some more complicated documentation with the context that the course provides. I think that the courses and learning pathways provide that really great first step to then start consuming the other content in the WordPress space so you don&#8217;t get overwhelmed. Some people might just want to dive in and get their hands dirty, but I think that the courses provide a very great entry point for developers, especially those who are new to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Nick, do you think that Learn.WordPress.org can become that one-stop shop for intermediate and advanced developers in the near future, or are we talking about a longer cycle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Well, I think that the learning pathways we have so far are great, and I think they cover a lot. I don&#8217;t think, given the amount of content—there&#8217;s so much to know around WordPress—you could probably spend years of your life just learning about building custom blocks, focusing on a very small area of WordPress. So I don&#8217;t expect that Learn WordPress will be able to cover absolutely everything, but I think it can provide people with a really good foundation for WordPress development. From there, they can maybe read a really niche article on the developer blog about a very specific topic related to block development, but it provides you with that foundation to then consume other more complicated pieces of content that you might see elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />I think it does, and I think all these things are increasingly working together. I know part of my role in the editorial group for the developer blog is to look at what is out there that matches this, what matches documentation, and what matches online. So increasingly, hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to cross-promote those things. Nick, I think you have an additional suggestion there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, well, just an anecdote really. I was engaging with a community member who was very new to WordPress. They wanted to solve this problem—they wanted to build this plugin. But when you build a plugin, you need to know how to register a plugin—the first step—and then you need to know how to do the thing you want it to do. Those are two completely different things. If you don&#8217;t know how to build a plugin, you can&#8217;t get the plugin to do what you want it to do. So, being able to direct that user to the Introduction to WordPress Development, they get all the foundation so they know how to do all the basic stuff, and then they can jump to building what they want. Whereas if they&#8217;re trying to jump to all these different documentation articles, it becomes very confusing. This user was quite frustrated with that experience. Learn WordPress provides the solution for them to really get up to speed and then build their skills further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And of course, the more people that get involved and help build some of these intermediate and advanced areas for users and developers, the quicker we&#8217;ll get to these solutions too. Thank you, Nick. Laura, in terms of the refreshed site, I know we&#8217;ve touched on a couple of things that you like about it already. What else would you encourage people to go and look at and feel that this is now something that will really help them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, we touched on the search and the navigation, and the thumbnails. Each of the lessons has a little thumbnail picture, and we&#8217;ve coordinated with the design team to create the thumbnail creation Figma file. That makes it a little bit more cohesive throughout—everything is kind of the same. That was another great way for contributors around the world to contribute—they could create the thumbnails. That was a great thing as a beginner to get used to contributing. We still need help with that. We&#8217;re now going back to all of our older lessons and some of the lessons from other teams that we have that still need help with thumbnails. So, I really like that aspect of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Again, we can put that link in because it&#8217;s really good. I remember doing that as part of a training day contributor event, where we created lots of thumbnails and helped each other—it was actually quite fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yes. Yeah, we had a thumbnail of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It was amazing. I had great fun on that. Contributing can be fun. If you subscribe to this channel regularly, or just hear me talk about WordPress, you&#8217;ll know that contributing can definitely be fun. On that note, I&#8217;m going to head back to Kathryn. For me, and for many people out there, the idea of a project keeping pace with a release is really hard because releases happen quite a few times a year, and there&#8217;s a lot to try and capture. How will this refreshed site help people get more connected to what&#8217;s in a release and learn about those things in a smoother way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />One of the things to keep an eye out for is online workshops. We haven&#8217;t talked about them a lot, but they are the real-time events that happen regularly and cover a topic. There are usually at least one or two online workshops for each new release. For 6.6, there were actually two different people who ran a workshop to go over some of the new features, which was really cool because different people have different perspectives on what are the things to highlight and how to show them. That was really amazing. In terms of maintaining the content over time, as areas of WordPress get updated and change, that&#8217;s going to be a discussion that we are having in the community about an ongoing content maintenance plan. It&#8217;s not one of the glamorous areas of maintaining the site, but it is something that really has to happen because we want people who do a search for something to find an up-to-date video that looks like what they see in their dashboard and reflects the steps that are currently relevant. We don&#8217;t want people getting frustrated by looking at an outdated lesson or screenshots or anything like that, but it isn&#8217;t a simple problem to solve. We have opened a discussion in the community; there&#8217;s a post that talks about how we want to create a plan. Is it going to be a process of going through things on a quarterly basis, on a semi-annual basis? Are we going to tie it to releases? How do we go in and update? Are there going to be priority areas that should be updated first before others? So, that is a whole set of questions that we are going to work on with the community to establish some guidelines. We&#8217;re also going to look at what other sites do. How do other sites maintain older content, and if so, for how long? What is a reasonable and realistic way for us to go about this because we have limited resources in terms of who&#8217;s going to be doing this work? I guess the short answer is: to be discussed, and we&#8217;ll know more once we&#8217;ve had more discussions with the community about how we&#8217;re going to go about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thanks, Kathryn. Again, we can put a link to this so that people can still take part. I presume it&#8217;s not a closed discussion; it&#8217;s an open discussion, and we want to have as many views as possible. One of the things that I always get feedback on when I do presentations on Learn WordPress to meetups is that this content isn&#8217;t necessarily in my local language. So, with this refreshed website, is there still room for content that&#8217;s not just in English? I&#8217;m going to go to Nick first on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, I think that one of the things the team is looking at is how we can handle translations on the site. There are courses and lessons currently in other languages. I think that kind of translation and making sites</p>\n\n\n\n<p>available in many different languages is kind of a core thing that WordPress is thinking about. I think it&#8217;s Phase 4 of the Gutenberg roadmap—multilingual. I think that obviously, we&#8217;re going to try and find a solution before multilingual because that will take some time, as WordPress releases tend to take some time. But I think it is something that&#8217;s on the team&#8217;s roadmap. I&#8217;m forgetting the name of the plugin—I think it&#8217;s TranslatePress—that is being looked at right now by the developer team to see if we can implement that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Laura, if people want to get involved now with actually translating some of the original content that exists, where would they go to get started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />That&#8217;s what I was talking about earlier—getting started, getting ahold of one of us to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested,&#8221; and we can start showing you the translation onboarding process. We&#8217;ve had a couple of glitches right now, so we&#8217;re kind of in a standstill, but we still want people to translate information, and we&#8217;ll definitely be able to walk you through how to add that within the ecosystem of learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thanks, Laura. Watch out for one of our future shows this year, where we&#8217;re going to be looking at multilingual. We have guests coming up who have been working in this area. I&#8217;m going to go back to Nick. For people who think, &#8220;Okay, the site&#8217;s got a refresh, it&#8217;s got a little bit more categorization, a better understanding, but it doesn&#8217;t answer what I need to learn,&#8221; what should they do? How can they influence the next focus for Learn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, absolutely. I think it&#8217;s really important to stress that everything we do on WordPress.org, especially Learn, is driven by contributors and the feedback we get from the community. Laura, being one of the leads for the training team, can speak to this as well, but if you see something that&#8217;s missing, advocate for that. Share it with the training team, share it with folks because if you&#8217;re seeing something that&#8217;s missing, it&#8217;s likely that others are looking for that as well. There&#8217;s only so much time in contributor time to get things done, but the more people advocating for certain topics, the more likely it will be created. Or if you end up learning about that yourself, consider contributing it back. I remember when I started on the training team long, long ago, all the online workshops I did for Learn were on topics I didn&#8217;t know about before I did the learning. I would learn the topic and then present it to the community. That&#8217;s a great way of learning the topic, and we move forward. It&#8217;s a very collaborative, very positive environment on the training team. I really encourage folks to get involved. It&#8217;s how I started contributing to WordPress, and it&#8217;s led me to where I am today, so I can&#8217;t say enough good things about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Laura, if people want to connect with the team reps like yourself in training, how do they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, usually the best way is to join the Slack training team. The Getting Started guide walks you through setting up a WordPress.org account and joining our Make WordPress Slack channel. You can see the different teams you can be involved with. People are involved with multiple teams too. It&#8217;s open to what you&#8217;re interested in. Our team currently has three team reps so that we can have coverage for a lot of different areas. We&#8217;re in multiple time zones, which is really beneficial so that we can focus in on and have presentations. We started doing coffee chats with our contributors. If they have questions for a more experienced contributor, they can ask those questions. We&#8217;re doing onboarding chats within our teams to meet with people face-to-face on Zoom so that they might feel a little more comfortable on camera too, and maybe we can get those people to do presentations. A lot of our contributors also have a connection with their community, with their local meetups. Learn.wordpress.org is a great resource to bring back to your local community. A couple of people have done presentations or are teaching a group of people using the WordPress user pathway, so they&#8217;re kind of testing for us, but they&#8217;re also using it for their community too. We&#8217;re excited to hear that feedback from people using the learning pathways within their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It is about that feedback. Nothing in WordPress moves forward without feedback. So, if you&#8217;re looking at the site, taking a course, or plunging into a module and taking some of Kathryn&#8217;s suggestions, trying out some of those courses—if you have feedback, there&#8217;s always a link at the end of each module that allows you to give feedback as well. Please do share it. Please remember, this site and its content are produced by contributors just like you—users of WordPress, people who love it. Be part of that. As we come toward our close today, I&#8217;ve got a few quick questions for the panel. Kathryn, I&#8217;m going to come to you first. Now you&#8217;re based in Canada—is it Montreal you&#8217;re in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Yes, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />A wonderful part of the world. Kathryn, we do a lot of talking about food on this program. I did warn you ahead of time to tell me about your favorite recipe and what it says about the culture and things that are around it. So what do you have for me today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathryn:<br />Well, I&#8217;m a huge baker, so it was very hard to choose, and I don&#8217;t even know if I could pick one thing, but I&#8217;ll tell you one personal favorite and one culturally relevant favorite, if that&#8217;s okay. The first one I want to mention is Never-Fail Chocolate Cake. So, my mom was moving into a new apartment, and she uncovered this recipe book that was created when I was in kindergarten. I was about five years old. In this book that she uncovered, there was one page that was just full of chocolate, and it was really disgusting. The reason it was so disgusting was that it was the one recipe she would make over and over—and she was not a baker, she still isn&#8217;t—but it was this Never-Fail Chocolate Cake. I looked at it and thought, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m curious to know what a recipe this old is like and if it&#8217;s any good anymore.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I made a few adjustments—I changed the shortening to butter, made a few tweaks—and it was actually delicious. It was a very easy recipe. It even inspired me to make a whole blog post about it, which doesn&#8217;t happen often. So, there&#8217;s a whole blog post about Never-Fail Chocolate Cake. Just very quickly, the other recipe is Butter Tart Squares. We have a thing in Canada, a dessert called Butter Tarts. Normally, they are little individual pastries with a pastry crust and then kind of like this gooey filling, similar to a pecan pie filling if you&#8217;ve had that. Sometimes there are nuts, sometimes there are raisins. I don&#8217;t ever have raisins because, to me, that&#8217;s just not a thing. But I discovered this recipe that&#8217;s a little easier than making individual butter tarts, and it&#8217;s Butter Tart Squares. It&#8217;s got layers of pastry crust, a layer of the goo, and a layer of pecans, and it&#8217;s just delicious—and it&#8217;s a very Canadian thing. So, those would be my two that I would share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />I am so hungry now. I think I need the Never-Fail Chocolate Cake in my life. What I didn&#8217;t tell you, of course, is that whatever you suggested, you might end up making live on one of the shows that we&#8217;re working on—a series of shows. But I think after hearing the Never-Fail Chocolate Cake, that&#8217;s going to be really popular with our audience, who will vote on the best recipes they want to see done live. So, I&#8217;m going to go to Nick, who looks a bit worried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit worried. I don&#8217;t cook as much as I should, or what I cook is not something that is worth sharing on this show—it&#8217;s quite boring. But one thing I do want to share is that my wife is Italian, and one of the things we cook quite a bit—I always pronounce this wrong, or however you want to pronounce it—is gnocchi, which is like a potato noodle with fresh homemade pasta sauce. Gnocchi is a very traditional dish, and our family&#8217;s been passing down the recipe forever. It&#8217;s very simple to make but very good. So that&#8217;s our go-to home-cooked pasta-type meal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Well, I can tell you to ease your concern that you&#8217;ve got a little time to practice how to pronounce it, and we may just have that on the show. Of course, we will be talking all things Woo at the same time, as you would expect. But it is to build on our WP recipe, and we&#8217;ve got some great ideas that we&#8217;re going to be sharing as well. So let me have those recipes. Laura, what have you got for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />So my recipes come from—I married into an Italian-Lithuanian family, and we have a lot of really good stuff. Bacon buns are a Lithuanian thing from my father-in-law, and it&#8217;s a yeast dough with ham predominantly, and then a little bit of bacon. Some people like to put onions in it too. So we&#8217;ve always made trays of bacon buns for different holidays. I&#8217;m also a big baker, so my go-to is éclair cake, which is graham crackers and vanilla pudding. When you let it sit overnight, it tastes like an éclair. So that&#8217;s been a family thing on my side of the family. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, our churches would have recipe books—that&#8217;s how the church would raise money. This was a recipe book from my aunt, and everyone&#8217;s made it in our family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />I love that idea. We&#8217;ve got some plans with how we&#8217;re going to support other contributors</p>\n\n\n\n<p>with our recipe stuff too. So yes, I think all three of you passed that test. I now know that Bob will be sitting there in the background on the show thinking about chocolate, bacon, and potatoes. So thank you very much for joining us. Before we go, I&#8217;m just going to ask Nick to share, I think, one of the most important things about the Learn WordPress project. It uses so many different skills and disciplines to make it happen and create the end result—to create the learning, the reflection, the understanding, and the localization. What makes it special, and what skills and disciplines from the people listening to the show would you like to appeal to come and get involved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick:<br />Yeah. Well, thanks for the question. I think you&#8217;re right; it is a very important one. So obviously, if you&#8217;re interested in creating educational material, the training team&#8217;s great for that. But if you&#8217;re a developer, a designer, or a copywriter, contributors from across the spectrum came together to make this possible. There&#8217;s actually an ongoing effort for WordPress.org as a whole to upgrade different areas of the site, with Learn WordPress being one of them. That includes people from the marketing team, marketing folks, people from Meta—the developers that maintain the website—we have designers, and then there&#8217;s me, who just floats across all sorts of different teams. It&#8217;s really a broad spectrum. So no matter what your skill set is, if you&#8217;re passionate about Learn, there&#8217;s a place for you, whether it&#8217;s creating educational content or even just helping with the architecture of the site. There&#8217;s an entire GitHub project board with features that we&#8217;d like to implement, which will require development, and that is something folks can help contribute to, as well as design work. So really, I just want to stress that no matter what your current skill set is, there is a place for you to contribute to both Learn WordPress and the broader WordPress community as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And we hope to see you there. And of course, if you do get involved with any of the things we&#8217;ve highlighted in the WordPress Way, then let us know. We won&#8217;t necessarily share your story if you&#8217;d rather we didn&#8217;t, but it does help us feed into the other interviews we do, and we&#8217;d always love to hear from our audience as well. Do look out for our next shows. We&#8217;ve got multilingual, a big reflection on the releases of this year later in November as well, and we&#8217;re going to fly over to a couple of other places as well. If we haven&#8217;t featured your country or your area of WooCommerce, do get in touch. I&#8217;m Nonstop News UK on Twitter. You can get my details from the make.wordpress.org profiles as well. All that remains for me to say is thank you to my wonderful panel today and goodbye from me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong>, host <strong>Abha Thakor</strong> is joined by <strong>Laura Adamonis, Nick Diego, and Kathryn Presner</strong> to discuss the latest updates to the Learn.WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three are contributors to the WordPress Training Team, and share insights into the newly refreshed learn.wordpress.org site, including the introduction of progressive and user-friendly learning pathways designed to cater to different types of learners at various skill levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore how the site offers a comprehensive and trusted resource for WordPress users, developers, and future contributors, with a special focus on making learning more accessible and tailored to individual needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refreshed Learn WordPress Platform</strong>: The newly updated learn.wordpress.org site offers tailored learning pathways for different types of WordPress users, including beginners, intermediate users, and developers.

The way I received love and value in a community is a story in itself, aside from receiving financial and geographical freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-i-feel-urge-to-contribute-to-the-most-engaging-community-wordpress\">Why I Feel Urge to Contribute to the Most Engaging Community- WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us begin by discussing the reason behind my strong desire to start and continue contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Mumtahina Faguni, born and living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Dhaka is our capital city and because of that, there is tons of opportunity for everyone to explore and execute. Fortunately, my volunteerism was first sparked during my school years. Like the phrase ‘Born Leader’ there is a term popular in my community: ‘Born Volunteer’. And I proudly acclaim that I am one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was involved in organizing a lot of school events and acts. I adored participating in projects that reflect my values and strengths. Volunteering is like recharging my energy battery; the more I do, the more energy I have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I entered university, I was overwhelmed by the introduction of tons of volunteer groups for versatile purposes. There was a volunteer group to help needy people with winter clothes, a group for donating blood, a group for helping to grow underrepresented communities, and so on. A few days later, I found out there were volunteer groups related to my field of study, computer science and engineering. Notable ones were the Mozilla Makers community, Women in Tech, Open Source Network groups, and many more. As time went on, a variety of factors, including differences in operation style, caused me to lose interest easily. I didn’t get the ‘should keep contributing’ vibe from here. And after a few days, I backed out of these and kept being active in other volunteer groups. </p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image4.jpg\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image4-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Mumtahina Faguni in a yellow saree \" class=\"wp-image-7292\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I have not mentioned WordPress&#8217; name in my narrative yet, let us move on to our first exchange. Back in my university days, I knew WordPress only as a PHP framework that provided many no-coding functionalities for users. So, I used WordPress only to complete my project. At that time, I wasn’t introduced to the WordPress world, so I didn’t get the chance to explore more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years later, in 2019, I heard for the first time that WordCamp was happening in my city, Dhaka. I had no idea it had anything to do with WordPress; I assumed it would be some sort of tech fair. But, attending the first WordCamp changed all my assumptions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got introduced to the most buzzing community, the WordPress community. On that day, I discovered a world full of amazing career opportunities, networking, making new friends, and other things, as well as how to start contributing to WordPress. Ever since WordPress has captured my heart, I have been learning a lot about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest power of the WordPress community is that it accepts all kinds of diversity and gives a sense of belonging to the community. The community structure is so organized that anyone can start contributing at any time and age they want. Even if you take a break, the community will welcome you again with warmth. There is no discrimination; everybody helps and cheers you on. If you have new, out-of-the-box ideas to implement, you will always get support from the community. These factors inspired me to commit to making a contribution to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-wordpress-brings-my-dreams-and-manifestations-to-life\">How WordPress Brings My Dreams and Manifestations to Life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, I want to shed light on what I gained from WordPress. Growing up, the most common childhood dreams in my native Bangladesh were to become engineers, doctors, or pilots. I was no exception. I grew up, holding these dreams close to my heart. At a certain point, when I had to choose one option from the above three, I chose to be an engineer. I started dreaming that I would go to a beautiful European country for my higher studies, or be a tech crew of the National Geographic channel, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back at that time, on a lazy afternoon, while I was thinking about what I dreamed of and what I’m now, I got the answer from my inner self about what I really wanted. I want to travel, explore, and meet new people and cultures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a pilot would give me the power to explore new horizons. Similar benefits I would receive if I worked as a government doctor include the opportunity to visit new areas and cities and help people. If I had to summarize all of my childhood fantasies in one sentence, it would be that I wished to fly and transcend boundaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was always enthralled by the line from the movie Forrest Gump: &#8220;Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far, far away.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, realizing dreams and making them come true is not a simple process. Processing paperwork and managing finances from my home country takes time. In addition, I needed to find employment quickly. Thus, life took place. And continuing one after another event, my dreams got shadowed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I learned about WordCamps, I burst with joy. WordCamp is the kind of event that will allow me to socialize with new people, make friends, and venture beyond my comfort zone. Since that moment, I’ve started manifesting. How can I be a part of a WordCamp? How to attend a WordCamp outside my city; I started wondering about these. And it took me three years to attend WordCamp Kolkata 2022, the event I eventually joined. It was one of the happiest days of my life when I got selected as a volunteer for WordCamo Kolkata 2022. My WordCamp adventure continued after that. Now I have WordCamp Asia 2023, WordCamp Sylhet 2023, and WordCamp Sylhet 2024 in my sack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, I will be an organizer at WordCamp Asia 2025, which is coming up soon. When I shared this latest news of my life, I was showered with wishes and love. Also, I heard I got lucky, as I was able to be a part of back-to-back WordCamps. However, I am aware that this is the outcome of my manifestation for the next three and a half years. When someone succeeds in something they love, it is usually the consequence of months or years of perseverance and not letting go of dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through WordCamps, I made incredibly good friends from all over the world, including Rahul, Sunita, Dominica, Maya, Emma, and Prema. It makes me wonder how I might never have met these incredible people if I hadn&#8217;t begun my WordCamp journey. Regardless of borders, I never would have guessed that there are people with whom I share such similar thought processes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-my-place-how-i-made-make-wordpress-community-my-home\">Finding My Place: How I Made Make WordPress Community My Home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress began with my job. Subsequently, I became aware of WordCamps, a fairyland for me. A few times later, I found my way to the Make WordPress community, another magical place. I discovered there were several ways to contribute to WordPress, including designing, developing, using the CLI, writing documentation, solving tickets, etc. However, I was having trouble figuring out where I should or could start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning translation was the simplest way to contribute, as I discovered when I attended WordCamp Dhaka 2019, my first WordCamp. I went to WordPress.org&#8217;s Polyglot page and began translating. However, I was unable to find any direction or endorsement from the Polyglot team. Are my translations incorrect? Am I adding to the incorrect string? I was unable to locate any information. Eventually, I gave up on it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years later, in my present office, our owner, Asif Bhai, called all the enthusiastic people in our office and gave a brief on how to take the first step. And that was through joining the Slack channel called Make WordPress. I entered a whole new world after that. That day, I discovered that participating in a weekly Slack channel meeting counts as a contribution as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I joined my preferred channels and started attending meetings. There, I found various chores where I could get involved. Also, not to mention, I was introduced to amazing people like Courtney, Ben, Ava, Puja, Destiny, See Ree, Yevitt, etc. Still, now I am learning and contributing to places where I think I am well-suited.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After participating in the Make WordPress community for a few days, I became aware of the concept of &#8220;Core Contribution.&#8221; If you contribute to the upcoming WordPress version, it will be counted as a core contribution. Writing documentation, creating long-lasting WordPress banners, resolving tickets, having your created tickets chosen for the upcoming WordPress release, and many other methods will identify your contribution as core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get my Core contribution acknowledgment, I got help from my WordPress guardian, Robin Bhai. He guided us on how to test tickets and provide solutions to them. I thus contributed to the most recent WordPress release. It was indeed a different kind of warm feeling to see your name listed among the contributors to WordPress Core.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do I go from here? I have already made contributions to the Polyglots, Training, and Marketing Slack channels. Now I want to expand my horizons and be active in contributing to other channels like documentation, etc. Let us explore the next opportunities and pleasures that lie ahead of us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-all-about-love-that-matters-amp-giving-back\">It&#8217;s All About Love, That Matters &amp; Giving Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me growing and going in the WordPress community, aside from achieving financial independence through employment in a WordPress-based company, is love. I am really grateful to have received love and acceptance from the WordPress community. Here&#8217;s where I can just be myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few small yet noteworthy gestures that deserve recognition. When WordCamp Sylhet 2024 happened, I was the Contributor Dya Table Lead, and my eight-month-old daughter was with me the entire time. Since it was my first time attending an event of any kind with my baby, I was quite anxious about how I would manage. But as soon as I arrived at the Contributor Day location, all of my anxiety vanished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My lovely leads and organizers, along with my office team, took care of my baby so I could do my job flawlessly. I am not sure how much my words expressed my gratitude to them compared to how I truly felt. This experience gave me confidence that, despite changes in my life, I can still pursue my passions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Mumtahina and Aurora speaking to an office room full of people\" class=\"wp-image-7294\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another story that is worth sharing. A few months ago, my partner decided to summit EBC in Nepal. We were both at a loss due to some dependency that needed to be done by the locals. I reached out to one of my WordPress friends for guidance. She did more than just provide me with the ideas I needed—she went above and beyond to complete the task. For an amazing person like her, expressing love in this way is very typical, but I was overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless touching tales just like them. I truly consider the love I have received from the WordPress community to be priceless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I do not have a lot of power in my community, I still make an effort to assist others. If I could get proper guidance, I might start my journey with WordPress sooner. A portion of girls in our nation find coding to be challenging. Thus, they avoid any fields that are related to coding. However, there are a plethora of ways to contribute to communities, such as WordPress. I therefore co-organized a Women in WordPress meetup in 2022 to raise awareness of my surroundings. Many working women joined, and we gave them lots of advice on how to use WordPress for interests other than work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordCamp Sylhet 2024, my panel discussion topic was to inspire underrepresented communities. Following the session, one of the young contributors became enthusiastic and expressed his desire to encourage non-techies to become more familiar with WordPress. I became so excited that I gave him some ideas on how to raise awareness and include more people. Now he successfully runs his university WordPress meetup community. These little things always give me a lift.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image3.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Organizers of WordCamp Sylhet on stage\" class=\"wp-image-7296\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, I had to take a long break from all my volunteering chores due to my pregnancy. Now, I’m the mother of a beautiful baby girl, Aurora. I must admit that I was aware of the difficulties faced by girls who do not participate or contribute in various ways, but I had no idea how difficult it is for mothers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially as a working mother, you have to juggle taking care of the baby, the house, and the office all at once. Furthermore, there are few facilities available to working mothers! Not only do some offices lack baby daycare centers, but they also lack areas for feeding and pumping. Additionally, going to meetups other than after work seems chaotic. Since the idea of a babysitter is uncommon in our nation, if someone wishes to attend a WordCamp, WordPress event, or any other function, she must bring a plus one to help with babysitting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, I have a loving family and a positive work environment. I have also started making little contributions to WordPress once more. But, I am now more driven to work for these kinds of individuals. To allow everyone return after a long absence and participate in the community whenever they so choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-final-thoughts\">My Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have personal motivation to keep doing something or being committed to something. For me and WordPress, that is love. I feel really lucky to have been introduced to such a wonderful, welcoming community. And I am trying my best every time to give back love and assist whenever needed. Thanks, WordPress for bringing all the beautiful things into my life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My story has just begun, and I know that there are many more stories related to my journey with WordPress that will be created in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7288_4c2d2d-45 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7288_79c5f0-fc\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading7288_a95104-1d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Mumtahina&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Mumtahina for a view into her development life and this is what she sent!</p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mumta_desk.jpg\" alt=\"Mumtahina Faguni&#8217;s Desk\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading7288_8f9e86-0f wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bengali\">WordPress এবং আমার ভালোবাসার যাত্রা: কিভাবে শুরু হলো পথ চলা</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>বাংলাদেশের একটি মেয়ের গল্প, যে তার জীবনের সবচেয়ে প্রিয় স্বেচ্ছাসেবী সংগঠনে স্থানে স্থান করে নিয়েছে। একটি কমিউনিটিতে যে ভাবে আমি ভালোবাসা এবং মূল্য পেয়েছি, তার একটি গল্প, আর্থিক এবং ভৌগোলিক স্বাধীনতা পাওয়ার সাথে।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ক-ন-আম-wordpress-এর-সবচ-য-আকর-ষণ-য-কম-উন-ট-ত-অবদ-ন-র-খ-র-ত-গ-দ-অন-ভব-কর\">কেন আমি WordPress-এর সবচেয়ে আকর্ষণীয় কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার তাগিদ অনুভব করি?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আসুন আমি কেন WordPress-এ অবদান রাখতে শুরু করেছি এবং এটি চালিয়ে যাওয়ার শক্তিশালী ইচ্ছার পেছনের কারণ জানি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি মুমতাহিনা ফাগুনী, ঢাকায় জন্মেছি এবং বাস করছি। ঢাকা আমাদের রাজধানী শহর এবং এ কারণে সবার জন্য কাজ করার প্রচুর সুযোগ রয়েছে। ভাগ্যক্রমে, আমার স্বেচ্ছাসেবী কাজের উত্সাহ প্রথম থেকেই স্কুল জীবনে শুরু হয়। ‘জন্মগত নেতা’ শব্দটির মতো, আমাদের কমিউনিটিতে একটি জনপ্রিয় শব্দ রয়েছে &#8211; ‘জন্মগত স্বেচ্ছাসেবী’। এবং আমি গর্বের সাথে বলি যে আমি একজন।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি অনেক স্কুল ইভেন্ট এবং কার্যক্রম সংগঠনে জড়িত ছিলাম। আমি এমন প্রকল্পগুলিতে অংশগ্রহণ করতে ভালোবাসি যা আমার মূল্যবোধ এবং শক্তিগুলির প্রতিফলন করে। স্বেচ্ছাসেবা আমার শক্তি ব্যাটারি চার্জ করার মতো; যত বেশি করি, তত বেশি শক্তি পাই।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় জীবনে প্রবেশ করার পর, আমি বিভিন্ন ধরনের স্বেচ্ছাসেবী দলের সাথে পরিচিত হয়ে অভিভূত হয়ে পড়ি। দরিদ্রদের শীতকালীন পোশাক সরবরাহ করার জন্য একটি দল ছিল, রক্তদান করার জন্য একটি দল, এবং একটি দল ছিল আন্ডাররিপ্রেজেন্টেড সম্প্রদায়গুলিকে সহায়তা করার জন্য। কয়েকদিন পর, আমি জানতে পারি যে আমার পড়াশোনার সাথে সম্পর্কিত স্বেচ্ছাসেবী দলও রয়েছে, যেমন Mozilla Makers Community, Women in Tech, Open Source Network Groups, ইত্যাদি। সময়ের সাথে সাথে, বিভিন্ন অপারেশন স্টাইলের কারণে আমি সহজেই আগ্রহ হারিয়ে ফেলি। আমি সেখান থেকে ‘অবদান রাখা উচিত’ এই অনুভূতি পাইনি। আর কয়েকদিন পর, আমি সেগুলি থেকে পিছিয়ে পড়ি এবং অন্য স্বেচ্ছাসেবী দলে সক্রিয় থাকি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এখনও পর্যন্ত আমি WordPress-এর নাম উল্লেখ করিনি, আসুন আমাদের প্রথম পরিচয়টি নিয়ে কথা বলি। আমার বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় জীবনে, আমি WordPress-কে শুধুমাত্র একটি PHP ফ্রেমওয়ার্ক হিসাবে জানতাম যা ব্যবহারকারীদের জন্য অনেক নো-কোডিং কার্যকারিতা সরবরাহ করে। তাই, আমি শুধুমাত্র আমার প্রজেক্ট সম্পূর্ণ করার জন্য WordPress ব্যবহার করতাম। তখন আমি WordPress-এর জগতে পরিচিত ছিলাম না, তাই আমি আরও অন্বেষণ করার সুযোগ পাইনি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বছর কয়েক পরে, ২০১৯ সালে, আমি প্রথমবার শুনেছিলাম যে আমার শহর, ঢাকায় WordCamp হচ্ছে। আমি জানতাম না এর কিছুই WordPress-এর সাথে সম্পর্কিত ছিল; আমি ভেবেছিলাম এটি একটি টেক ফেয়ার হবে। কিন্তু, প্রথম WordCamp-এ উপস্থিত হয়ে আমার সমস্ত ধারণা বদলে গেল।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি WordPress-এর সবচেয়ে প্রতাপশালী কমিউনিটিতের সাথে পরিচিত হলাম। সেদিন, আমি একটি বিশ্ব আবিষ্কার করলাম যেখানে চমৎকার ক্যারিয়ারের সুযোগ, নেটওয়ার্কিং, নতুন বন্ধুত্ব গঠন, এবং আরও অনেক কিছু ছিল, যেমন WordPress-এ কন্ট্রিবিউশন শুরু করার উপায়। তখন থেকেই WordPress আমার হৃদয়কে জয় করে নিয়েছে, এবং আমি এখনও এটি সম্পর্কে অনেক কিছু শিখছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress কমিউনিটিতের সবচেয়ে বড় শক্তি হল এটি সকল ধরনের বৈচিত্র্যকে গ্রহণ করে এবং কমিউনিটির সাথে একাত্মতার অনুভূতি দেয়। কমিউনিটিতে কাঠামো এতটাই সংগঠিত যে যে কেউ তাদের পছন্দমতো সময় এবং বয়সে অবদান রাখতে পারে। আপনি যদি বিরতি নেন, সম্প্রদায় আপনাকে আবার উষ্ণ অভ্যর্থনা জানাবে। এখানে কোন বৈষম্য নেই, সবাই সাহায্য করে এবং আপনাকে উৎসাহিত করে। যদি আপনার নতুন, বক্সের বাইরে চিন্তা করার আইডিয়া থাকে, সম্প্রদায় থেকে সবসময় সমর্থন পাবেন। এই সমস্ত কারণগুলো আমাকে WordPress-এ অবদান রাখতে উৎসাহিত করেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ক-ভ-ব-wordpress-আম-র-স-বপ-ন-এব-আক-ঙ-ক-ষ-গ-ল-ব-স-তব-য-ত-কর-ছ\">কীভাবে WordPress আমার স্বপ্ন এবং আকাঙ্ক্ষাগুলি বাস্তবায়িত করেছে</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>এখানে আমি WordPress থেকে কী পেয়েছি তা নিয়ে আলোকপাত করতে চাই। বড় হওয়ার সময়, আমার দেশে বাংলাদেশে সবচেয়ে সাধারণ শৈশব স্বপ্ন ছিল ইঞ্জিনিয়ার, ডাক্তার, বা পাইলট হওয়া। আমি এর ব্যতিক্রম ছিলাম না। আমি বড় হলাম, এই স্বপ্নগুলোকে হৃদয়ে ধরে রাখলাম। একটি নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে, যখন আমাকে উপরের তিনটি থেকে একটি বিকল্প বেছে নিতে হয়েছিল, আমি ইঞ্জিনিয়ার হওয়ার সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছিলাম। আমি স্বপ্ন দেখা শুরু করলাম যে আমি আমার উচ্চতর শিক্ষার জন্য একটি সুন্দর ইউরোপীয় দেশে যাব, বা National Geographic Channel-এর টেক ক্রু হব, এবং আরও কত কিছু।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>তখন, একটি অলস বিকেলে, আমি যা স্বপ্ন দেখেছি এবং আমি এখন কী, তা নিয়ে চিন্তা করছিলাম, তখন আমার ভেতর থেকে একটি উত্তর পেলাম যা আমি সত্যিই চাই। আমি ভ্রমণ করতে চাই, নতুন মানুষ এবং সংস্কৃতির সাথে পরিচিত হতে চাই।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>একজন পাইলট হওয়া আমাকে নতুন দিগন্ত অন্বেষণ করার ক্ষমতা দিত। একই সুবিধা আমি পাবো যদি আমি একজন সরকারী ডাক্তার হিসেবে কাজ করি, যেমন নতুন এলাকা এবং শহর পরিদর্শনের সুযোগ এবং মানুষদের সাহায্য করা। আমার সমস্ত শৈশবের কল্পনা এক বাক্যে সংক্ষিপ্ত করলে, এটি হবে আমি উড়তে এবং সীমানা অতিক্রম করতে চেয়েছিলাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি সবসময় &#8220;Forrest Gump&#8221; সিনেমার একটি লাইন দ্বারা মুগ্ধ ছিলাম: &#8220;Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far, far away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>তবে, স্বপ্নগুলি বাস্তবায়িত করা এবং সেগুলি বাস্তবে রূপান্তরিত করা সহজ প্রক্রিয়া নয়। আমার নিজ দেশের থেকে কাগজপত্র প্রক্রিয়াকরণ এবং অর্থ পরিচালনা করতে সময় লাগে। এছাড়াও, আমাকে দ্রুত চাকরি খুঁজে বের করতে হয়েছিল। একটির পর একটি ঘটনা চলতে থাকে, আমার স্বপ্নগুলি ধীরে ধীরে অন্ধকারে চলে যায়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>যখন আমি WordCamps সম্পর্কে জানলাম, আমি আনন্দে ভরপুর ছিলাম। WordCamp এমন একটি ইভেন্ট যা আমাকে নতুন মানুষদের সাথে মেশার, বন্ধু বানানোর এবং আমার সান্ত্বনার অঞ্চলের বাইরে যাত্ৰার সুযোগ দেবে। সেই মুহূর্ত থেকে, আমি বাস্তবায়নের চিন্তা শুরু করি। কীভাবে আমি WordCamp-এর অংশ হতে পারি? কীভাবে আমার শহরের বাইরের WordCamp-এ অংশগ্রহণ করতে পারি; আমি এসব ভাবতে শুরু করি। এবং WordCamp-এ যোগ দিতে আমার ৩ বছর সময় লেগেছিল, এটি ছিল WordCamp Kolkata 2022। এটি ছিল আমার জীবনের সবচেয়ে সুখের দিনগুলির মধ্যে একটি, যখন আমি WordCamp Kolkata 2022-এ স্বেচ্ছাসেবক হিসেবে নির্বাচিত হয়েছিলাম। তারপর থেকে আমার WordCamp অ্যাডভেঞ্চার চলতে থাকে। এখন আমার ঝুলিতে আরও আছে WordCamp Asia 2023, WordCamp Sylhet 2023, এবং WordCamp Sylhet 2024।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এছাড়াও, আমি শীঘ্রই আসন্ন WordCamp Asia 2025-এ সংগঠক হিসাবে থাকব। যখন আমি আমার জীবনের এই সংবাদটি শেয়ার করেছিলাম, অনেক শুভেচ্ছা এবং ভালোবাসায় পূর্ণ হয়ে গেলাম। এছাড়াও, আমি শুনেছি যে আমি ভাগ্যবান ছিলাম, কারণ আমি পরপর WordCamp-এর অংশ হতে পেরেছি। তবে, আমি জানি এটি আমার সাড়ে তিন বছরের বাস্তবায়নের ফলাফল। যখন কেউ তাদের ভালোবাসার কিছুতে সফল হয়, এটি সাধারণত কয়েক মাস বা বছরের অধ্যবসায়ের ফল এবং স্বপ্নগুলোকে ছাড়িয়ে না যাওয়ার কারণে ঘটে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps-এর মাধ্যমে, আমি বিশ্বজুড়ে অত্যন্ত ভালো বন্ধু পেয়েছি, যেমন Rahul, Sunita, Dominica, Maya, Emma, এবং Prema। এখন আমার মনে হয়, যদি আমি আমার WordCamp যাত্রা শুরু না করতাম, তবে কীভাবে এই মানুষগুলির সাথে পরিচিত হতাম। সীমানা পেরিয়ে, আমি কখনো ভাবিনি যে এমন মানুষদের সাথে দেখা হবে যাদের সাথে আমার চিন্তা এতটাই মিলে যাবে।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ক-ভ-ব-আম-make-wordpress-কম-উন-ট-ক-ন-জ-র-দ-ব-ত-য-ঘর-ব-ন-ল-ম-nbsp\">কিভাবে আমি Make WordPress কমিউনিটিকে নিজের দ্বিতীয় ঘর বানালাম&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার WordPress-এর যাত্রা শুরু হয় আমার চাকরির মাধ্যমে। এরপর আমি WordCamps সম্পর্কে জানতে পারি, যা আমার জন্য এক পরীর দেশ ছিল। কিছুদিন পর, আমি Make WordPress কমিউনিটিতে যোগ দিই, যা আরেকটি জাদুকরী স্থান ছিল। আমি জানতে পারি যে WordPress-এ অবদান রাখার জন্য বিভিন্ন উপায় রয়েছে, যেমন ডিজাইন করা, ডেভেলপ করা, CLI ব্যবহার করা, ডকুমেন্টেশন লেখা, টিকিট সমাধান করা ইত্যাদি। তবে, আমি বুঝতে পারছিলাম না যে কোথা থেকে বা কীভাবে শুরু করা উচিত।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>সবচেয়ে সহজ উপায় হিসেবে অনুবাদ শুরু করার কথা আমি প্রথম বুঝতে পারি যখন আমি WordCamp Dhaka 2019-এ অংশগ্রহণ করি, যা ছিল আমার প্রথম WordCamp। আমি WordPress.org-এর Polyglot পৃষ্ঠায় গিয়ে অনুবাদ শুরু করি। কিন্তু, আমি Polyglot টিমের কাছ থেকে কোনো নির্দেশনা বা সমর্থন পাইনি। আমার অনুবাদগুলো কি ভুল ছিল? আমি কি ভুল স্ট্রিংয়ে যোগ করছি? আমি কোনো তথ্য খুঁজে পাইনি। অবশেষে, আমি এটাও ছেড়ে দিই।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>কয়েক বছর পরে, আমার বর্তমান অফিসে, আমাদের মালিক, আসিফ ভাই, আমাদের অফিসের সমস্ত উৎসাহী মানুষকে ডেকে প্রথম পদক্ষেপটি কীভাবে নিতে হবে সে সম্পর্কে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরণ দেন। এবং তা ছিল Make WordPress নামে একটি Slack চ্যানেলে যোগদান করা। এরপর আমি এক সম্পূর্ণ নতুন জগতে প্রবেশ করি। সেদিন, আমি জানতে পারি যে সাপ্তাহিক Slack চ্যানেল মিটিংয়ে অংশগ্রহণ করাও একটি অবদান হিসেবে গণ্য হয়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এরপর আমি আমার পছন্দের চ্যানেলগুলোতে যোগদান করি এবং মিটিংয়ে অংশগ্রহণ করতে শুরু করি। সেখানে, আমি বিভিন্ন কাজ খুঁজে পাই যেখানে আমি যুক্ত হতে পারি। এছাড়াও, উল্লেখ করা প্রয়োজন, আমি অসাধারণ মানুষদের সাথে পরিচিত হই, যেমন কোর্টনি, বেন, আভা, পূজা, ডেসটিনি, সি রি, ইভিট, ইত্যাদি। এখনও, আমি শিখছি এবং এমন জায়গায় অবদান রাখছি যেখানে আমি নিজেকে উপযুক্ত মনে করি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make WordPress কমিউনিটিতে কিছুদিন অংশগ্রহণ করার পরে, আমি &#8220;কোর কন্ট্রিবিউশন&#8221; ধারণাটি সম্পর্কে অবগত হই। আপনি যদি আসন্ন WordPress সংস্করণে অবদান রাখেন, তবে তা কোর কন্ট্রিবিউশন হিসেবে গণ্য হবে। ডকুমেন্টেশন লেখা, দীর্ঘস্থায়ী WordPress ব্যানার তৈরি করা, টিকিট সমাধান করা, আপনার তৈরি করা টিকিটগুলি আসন্ন WordPress রিলিজের জন্য নির্বাচিত হওয়া এবং অন্যান্য অনেক উপায়ে আপনার অবদানকে কোর হিসেবে গণ্য করা হবে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার কোর কন্ট্রিবিউশন স্বীকৃতি পাওয়ার জন্য, আমি আমার WordPress গার্ডিয়ান, রবিন ভাই থেকে সাহায্য পাই। তিনি আমাদের টিকিট পরীক্ষা করার এবং সেগুলোর সমাধান দেওয়ার উপায়গুলি শিখিয়েছিলেন। এভাবে আমি সর্বশেষ WordPress রিলিজে অবদান রাখি। WordPress Core-এর অবদানকারীদের মধ্যে আপনার নামটি দেখতে পাওয়া একটি বিশেষ ধরনের উষ্ণ অনুভূতি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এখন আমি কোথায় যাব? আমি ইতিমধ্যে Polyglots, Training, এবং Marketing Slack চ্যানেলগুলোতে অবদান রেখেছি। এখন আমি আমার দিগন্ত প্রসারিত করতে চাই এবং ডকুমেন্টেশন ইত্যাদির মতো অন্যান্য চ্যানেলগুলিতে সক্রিয়ভাবে অবদান রাখতে চাই। আসুন আমরা সামনে থাকা পরবর্তী সুযোগগুলি এবং আনন্দগুলি অন্বেষণ করি।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ভ-ল-ব-স-যত-ন-আর-ফ-র-দ-ওয-র-গল-প\">ভালোবাসা, যত্ন, আর ফিরে দেওয়ার গল্প</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার WordPress কমিউনিটিতে বেড়ে ওঠা এবং এগিয়ে যাওয়ার প্রেরণা যে ভালোবাসা থেকে আসে, তা ছাড়াও, WordPress-ভিত্তিক কোম্পানিতে কাজ করে আর্থিক স্বাধীনতা অর্জন করাটাও একটি বড় কারণ। আমি WordPress কমিউনিটি থেকে যে ভালোবাসা এবং গ্রহণযোগ্যতা পেয়েছি, তার জন্য আমি সত্যিই কৃতজ্ঞ। এখানে আমি আমার নিজেকে প্রকাশ করতে পারি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>কিছু ছোট কিন্তু উল্লেখযোগ্য ঘটনা রয়েছে, যা অবশ্যই স্বীকৃতি পাওয়ার যোগ্য। যখন WordCamp Sylhet 2024 হলো, তখন আমি Contributor Day-এর টেবিল লিড ছিলাম, এবং আমার আট মাস বয়সী ছেলে সারা সময় আমার সাথে ছিল। যেহেতু এটি আমার প্রথমবারের মতো কোন ইভেন্টে বাচ্চার সাথে অংশগ্রহণ করা, তাই আমি বেশ চিন্তিত ছিলাম কিভাবে আমি এটি পরিচালনা করবো। কিন্তু Contributor Day-এর স্থানে পৌঁছানোর পরপরই, আমার সব চিন্তা মুছে গেল।</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2.jpg\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Mumtahina and Aurora in front of the contributor day sign at WordCamp Sylhet.\" class=\"wp-image-7298\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার প্রিয় লিড এবং আয়োজকরা, অফিসের টিম সহ, আমার বাচ্চার যত্ন নিয়েছিল যাতে আমি আমার কাজ নিখুঁতভাবে করতে পারি। আমি নিশ্চিত নই আমার কথাগুলি তাদের প্রতি আমার আসল কৃতজ্ঞতার তুলনায় কতটা প্রকাশ করতে পেরেছে। এই অভিজ্ঞতাটি আমাকে আত্মবিশ্বাস দিয়েছে যে, আমার জীবনে পরিবর্তন আসলেও, আমি এখনও আমার আবেগকে অনুসরণ করতে পারি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আরও একটি গল্প আছে যা শেয়ার করা মূল্যবান। কয়েক মাস আগে, আমার সঙ্গী নেপালে EBC সামিট করার সিদ্ধান্ত নেন। কিছু স্থানীয়দের মাধ্যমে নির্ভরশীল কাজগুলি সম্পন্ন করতে না পারায় আমরা হতবাক ছিলাম। আমি আমার এক WordPress বন্ধুর কাছে পরামর্শের জন্য পৌঁছালাম। তিনি শুধু আমাকে প্রয়োজনীয় ধারণাগুলি দেননি, বরং তার কাজ শেষ করতে আরও বেশি সাহায্য করেছেন। তার মতো অসাধারণ একজন মানুষের জন্য এইভাবে ভালোবাসা প্রকাশ করা স্বাভাবিক হলেও, আমি অভিভূত হয়েছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এরকম অসংখ্য স্পর্শকাতর গল্প রয়েছে। আমি সত্যিই WordPress কমিউনিটি থেকে পাওয়া ভালোবাসাকে অমূল্য মনে করি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>যদিও আমার কমিউনিটিতে অনেক ক্ষমতা নেই, তবুও আমি অন্যদের সাহায্য করার চেষ্টা করি। যদি আমি সঠিক দিকনির্দেশনা পেতাম, তাহলে আমি হয়তো WordPress-এর সাথে আমার যাত্রা আরও আগে শুরু করতে পারতাম। আমাদের দেশে অনেক মেয়ে কোডিংকে চ্যালেঞ্জিং মনে করে। তাই তারা কোডিং সম্পর্কিত যেকোন ক্ষেত্র থেকে দূরে থাকে। তবে, WordPress-এর মতো কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার জন্য অনেক উপায় রয়েছে। তাই আমি ২০২২ সালে একটি Women in WordPress মিটআপ সহ-আয়োজন করি যাতে আমার আশেপাশে সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধি করতে পারি। অনেক কর্মজীবী নারী এতে যোগ দেন, এবং আমরা তাদেরকে কাজ ছাড়াও WordPress ব্যবহার করার বিষয়ে অনেক পরামর্শ দিয়েছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Sylhet 2024-এ, আমার প্যানেল আলোচনার বিষয় ছিল প্রতিনিধিত্বহীন কমিউনিটিকে উৎসাহিত করা। সেশনের পরে, এক তরুণ কন্ট্রিবিউটর উৎসাহী হয়ে ওঠেন এবং non-techies-দের WordPress-এর সাথে পরিচিত করার ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করেন। আমি এতটাই উত্তেজিত হয়েছিলাম যে আমি তাকে কিছু ধারণা দিলাম কিভাবে সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধি করা যায় এবং আরও মানুষকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা যায়। এখন তিনি সফলভাবে তার বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের WordPress মিটআপ কমিউনিটি পরিচালনা করছেন। এই ছোট ছোট বিষয়গুলো সবসময় আমাকে উজ্জীবিত করে।</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image5.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image5-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"A panel on stage at WordCamp Sylhet\" class=\"wp-image-7300\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>২০২৩ সালে, আমি আমার গর্ভধারণের কারণে সব স্বেচ্ছাসেবী কাজ থেকে দীর্ঘ বিরতি নিয়েছিলাম। এখন আমি একটি সুন্দর কন্যা শিশুর মা, যার নাম Aurora। আমি স্বীকার করতেই হবে যে, যারা বিভিন্ন উপায়ে অংশগ্রহণ বা অবদান রাখেন না তাদের সমস্যাগুলি আমি বুঝতে পারতাম, কিন্তু আমি মায়েদের জন্য কেমন কঠিন তা কখনও জানতাম না।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বিশেষ করে একজন কর্মজীবী মা হিসেবে, আপনাকে একসাথে বাচ্চার যত্ন নেওয়া, বাড়ি এবং অফিস পরিচালনা করতে হয়। তাছাড়া, কর্মজীবী মায়েদের জন্য খুব কম সুবিধা রয়েছে! কিছু অফিসে বেবি ডে কেয়ার সেন্টার না থাকার পাশাপাশি, ফিডিং এবং পাম্পিংয়ের জন্যও কোন জায়গা নেই। এছাড়াও, কাজের পরে মিটআপে যাওয়া প্রায়শই বিশৃঙ্খল মনে হয়। যেহেতু আমাদের দেশে বেবিসিটারের ধারণা কম, তাই কেউ যদি WordCamp, WordPress ইভেন্ট বা অন্য কোন ফাংশনে যোগ দিতে চান, তাকে বেবিসিটিংয়ের জন্য একজন সহকারী নিয়ে যেতে হয়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>সৌভাগ্যক্রমে, আমার একটি ভালোবাসাময় পরিবার এবং ইতিবাচক কাজের পরিবেশ রয়েছে। আমি আবার ছোট ছোট অবদান রাখতে শুরু করেছি WordPress-এ। কিন্তু, অনেকেই আছে যারা এই সুবিধাগুলো থেকে বঞ্চিত। আমি এখন এই ধরনের ব্যক্তিদের জন্য কাজ করতে চাই । প্রত্যেককে যেন দীর্ঘ অনুপস্থিতির পরে ফিরে আসাতে পারে এবং যখনই ইচ্ছে তখনি তারা পছন্দের গ্রুপে অংশগ্রহণ করতে পারে৷&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-আম-র-চ-ড-ন-ত-ভ-বন\">আমার চূড়ান্ত ভাবনা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি WordPress-এর সাথে যোগদান করার এবং অবদান রাখার সুযোগ পেয়ে নিজেকে ভাগ্যবান মনে করি। এটি আমার জন্য শুধু একটি কাজ নয়, এটি আমার জীবনের একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ হয়ে উঠেছে। WordPress সম্প্রদায় আমাকে একটি পরিবার প্রদান করেছে, যা আমি বিশ্বজুড়ে ছড়িয়ে দিতে চাই। আমি আশা করি যে আমার এই যাত্রা অন্যদেরকে তাদের ভালোবাসার জন্য অবদান রাখতে অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং তারা একই সুখ এবং আনন্দ পাবে যা আমি পেয়েছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার গল্পটি কেবল শুরু হয়েছে, এবং আমি জানি যে আমার WordPress-এর সাথে সম্পর্কিত আরও অনেক গল্প রয়েছে যা ভবিষ্যতে তৈরি হবে।</p>\n<p>The post <a

always trying out new things. First, something fun: my friend Jesse gifted me a very cool Gameboy-like device called <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-2024-new\">the Anbernic RG35XX</a>, at ~$46. It has almost every game you remember, like if you got all the cartridges at Toys R Us or checked them out at Blockbuster. Having something without Wi-Fi, notifications, etc., is nice to relax. Very fun. I&#8217;m also keeping my eye on <a href=\"https://modretro.com/\">Palmer Luckey&#8217;s new ModRetro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, <a href=\"https://solreader.com/\">I give to you the Sol E-reader</a>, $399, basically glasses with a Kindle built-in, and a remote you hold in your hand for turning pages. The website is slick, even the packaging and design was nice, but the product is not. <em>Do not buy this.</em> It&#8217;s really not pleasant to use. The resolution was so low and the typography so bad it felt like reading on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series\">TI-89 calculator</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, I&#8217;ve been really enjoying <a href=\"https://daylightcomputer.com/\">the DC-1 Daylight Computer</a>, $729, which is like if a Kindle mixed with an iPad in the best possible way. This feels like an actually new platform, in that I find myself imagining new ways and places (like outdoors) I&#8217;d want to spend time with it. It runs Android, so you can have any app on it, even code on it. This video gives a good sense of the device and its founder <a href=\"https://x.com/anjankatta\">Anjan Katta</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n	<img class=\"lyt-bg\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9M6zT0mRvW0/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n  <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=9M6zT0mRvW0\" class=\"lty-playbtn\" title=\"Play Video\">\n    <span class=\"lyt-visually-hidden\"></span>\n  </a>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see Daylight being fantastic for kids as well; it just feels less &#8220;toxic&#8221; than the hyper-display world in which smartphones have us trapped. Audrey <a href=\"https://audrey.co/\">invested back in 2022</a> and it&#8217;s awesome to see how this turned out, it&#8217;s so rare that hardware makes it to this stage. I&#8217;ve shifted a lot of my nighttime consumption and play over to the Daylight; it&#8217;s so fun to play chess or read an article. It has surpassed the Kindle as my favorite reading device. And it looks good everywhere:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"604\" height=\"805\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2024/08/IMG_7626-Large-768x1024.jpeg?resize=604%2C805&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123464\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"604\" height=\"805\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2024/08/IMG_7671-Large-768x1024.jpeg?resize=604%2C805&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123465\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"604\" height=\"805\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2024/08/IMG_07423D7B158B-1-768x1024.jpeg?resize=604%2C805&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123463\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I used the Daylight a lot on the recent Sydney to Hamilton Island ~1,000 mile transport I did with the <a href=\"https://rolexsydneyhobart.com/the-yachts/2023/oroton-drumfire/?raceId=176&SeriesId=2\">Drumfire crew</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herman__music/\">my friend Herman/John</a>, which was part of my &#8220;learning to sail&#8221; goal for this year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 15:17:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WordCamp Central: Bridging Africa’s Digital Gaps: The PayDel Summit 2024 (A WordPress Event)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=7610169\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2024/08/bridging-africas-digital-gaps-the-paydel-summit-2024-a-wordpress-event/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5078:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The digital landscape of Africa is evolving rapidly, but significant challenges remain, particularly in the realms of online payments and product delivery. Stunning web applications have become the norm, showcasing products and services with visual brilliance. Yet, the journey from browsing to a successful transaction often encounters roadblocks, leaving many websites on the continent struggling to complete the checkout process or ensuring seamless delivery to customers.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the <strong>Online Payments &amp; Delivery Summit &#8211; Kampala 2024</strong> comes in.

This is your opportunity to gain valuable insights, connect with industry peers, and showcase your innovations to potential customers and investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us on <strong>October 18th, 2024</strong>, at <strong>The Innovation Village, Ntinda &#8211; Kampala</strong>, and be part of the movement that&#8217;s shaping the future of digital payments and delivery in Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/paydel\">https://bit.ly/paydel</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 15:01:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Joan Logose\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Do The Woo Community: AI Transparency and Trust with James LePage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85178\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://dothewoo.io/ai-transparency-and-trust-with-james-lepage/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58495:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-12 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-11 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-3 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"693\" height=\"693\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cloudways-.png?resize=693%2C693&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78795\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-4\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/?utm_source=dothewoo&utm_medium=Inlines&utm_campaign=dothewoopodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cloudways</a></strong>: Managed cloud hosting from Cloudways gives you the assurance that your hosted site is fast, secure and backed by 24/7 support is important to you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-10 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-5 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-9 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1509\" height=\"1038\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Woo-logo-color.png?resize=1509%2C1038&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-77744\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-6\"><strong><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/partners/\">WooCommerce</a></strong>: Join the official WooCommerce Marketplace and get your products in front of millions of engaged WooCommerce store owners.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nEpisode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Welcome to another episode of Do the Woo. I&#8217;m your co-host, Jonathan Wold, and with me again today is your other co-host, Tammie Lister. Tammie, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />I&#8217;m good, thank you. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Apparently a lot cooler than you are. How&#8217;s the heat over there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />We are having the two days of English summer, which are the two days I wish we had air conditioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Well, I hope you can stay cool over there. We have a great guest with us today. James LePage is joining us from a cooler part of the world. James, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I&#8217;m doing well. Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s fantastic to have you. James is the founder of WPAI, and we&#8217;re here today to talk about AI, eCommerce, WooCommerce, and the future and all those fun things. But before we get to any of that, James, you&#8217;ve been in this WordPress space for a while now. Tell us about yourself. When did you first come into the ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, I basically grew up in the WordPress ecosystem, and I got started as a young teen. I had just worked a kitchen job; I was a dishwasher, and that proved to me that there was no dishwashing in my future. I really wanted to do something other than that. So I tried to figure out what I could do that wouldn&#8217;t involve dishwashing, but would give me my little allowance money to go and have fun around town as a kid. Somehow, I stumbled into web design. I originally got started with page builders and worked for neighbors and my parents&#8217; friends, and eventually, it just grew and grew into something where I was working on more complex sites. Then I started selling to local businesses in my town, and that grew into me learning how to actually code. I learned how to code and really started freelancing as a true freelancer, eventually forming an agency called Isotropic. We grew to eight developers and built some pretty big projects, a lot of WooCommerce projects specifically for B2B. I continued that through college, then got into startups, did a startup called Share Club, and now here I am with WPAI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve really been in WordPress since I got started in anything digital or business-related. My whole career has been in WordPress, and it&#8217;s been really fun to grow up in the industry and have my skills grow alongside me. It&#8217;s also been really fun to insert myself more into the community over the past couple of years as well because when I was running the agency and building the sites, I was definitely on the outside looking in. Now, running WPAI and building products for WordPress creators and users, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to meet the people behind WordPress and WooCommerce and the communities around WordCamps and things like that. So it&#8217;s been really fun. Long story short, this has been my whole life and probably will continue to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />You have a journey that I think a lot of listeners can resonate with, where it started based on interest, and you built for others, especially if people started in the freelancer-to-agency space. You&#8217;ve been focused on product for quite some time now. Can you recall anything about that decision to switch from a focus on service to product? What motivated that? What was at the heart of that desire to make products?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Well, the long story short is we all love building things, but I know a lot of agency owners and creators who don&#8217;t always love the client management side of it. That was kind of the thing for me. I love building sites, and I love creating projects. I come from a family of architects, and I think my whole family just loves creating. When you put clients into the mix, sometimes you can have the most incredible clients ever, but sometimes you can have really difficult clients to work with. We found that to be the case at Isotropic, where there were some really big projects that were pretty mission-critical to some larger companies, and it was just very difficult and stressful. So I started looking at products and how we could move away from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also had a break in between my agency days and the WPAI days where I was a CTO at another venture-backed startup. So I was able to take a step back and really choose: Do I want to go into product, or do I want to go back into the agency and what we were doing? It was an easy decision for me to say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go try my hand at product.&#8221; I&#8217;d been using WordPress products for a long time. I&#8217;d been building WordPress companies and sites and things like that for a while, and it kind of just made sense to get into the product ecosystem. Specifically, for me, focusing on artificial intelligence was something I studied in university. So it was a really good mesh of everything. It was something that at the time, in 2022, was really just getting its legs and becoming the super exciting thing that it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also something that I knew about, and I knew that by applying it to an industry like WordPress and WooCommerce—one that I really knew—I could really bring a lot of value by combining everything into one company. So it was a really easy choice to get into the product landscape. We launched our first product in late 2022, and it was CodeWP. It was something that a lot of people were very interested in, so there was also buy-in and traction from the community. It was like, &#8220;Oh, this is probably the easiest decision ever.&#8221; People really liked what we were working on; we were doing something that people seemingly wanted, and it wasn&#8217;t something where we&#8217;d have to deal with difficult clients. So it was a really good introduction to what grew into WPAI, and it worked out very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />I&#8217;d love to start talking a little bit about AI specifically. There&#8217;s so much about the myth and concepts. If everyone&#8217;s describing AI, what does AI mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />That&#8217;s a very good question, and you&#8217;re completely right that there are so many different thoughts, ideas, and approaches to artificial intelligence. For us, we&#8217;re looking at AI as a way to help people do things that they&#8217;ve always done in WordPress and WooCommerce in a much easier and more efficient way. We&#8217;re leveraging a lot of the technologies that are being applied to many other industries and businesses, and we&#8217;re just using them to create tools that bring value to our industry. So for us, what AI means is a modern way, a new way to go and do business and enable the creators and users of WordPress in a way that couldn&#8217;t be done before. There&#8217;s the technical side of AI, and there&#8217;s a lot to unpack in that area as well. You could talk for days about how it actually works, how you can apply it, the different types of applications, and the various models and underlying structures of these models. But for us, our goal is to apply modern AI—primarily large language models based on Transformers architecture—to make our industry better and bring value to our industry. That&#8217;s always been our approach: sticking in the WordPress industry and doing what needs to be done for WordPress to make everybody&#8217;s lives a bit easier. That&#8217;s our approach and our focus on AI. But I mean, I&#8217;m happy to get into the technicals and all of it, but it might be an eight-hour-long podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />I guess I&#8217;d like to kind of build on that. I would love to go into technicals, and maybe we&#8217;ll get some opportunities in some later questions as well. But you mentioned ways to help; I&#8217;d love to also think about some of the limitations today. What are the limitations on being able to help, and the limitations on tools? Sometimes it feels like AI can solve everything the way that people speak about it or that it&#8217;s going to do everything. What&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to debunk that people always get wrong about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />That&#8217;s a good one as well. I think that first off, AI is very hyped, and it&#8217;s rightfully hyped because I think it brings a lot of value to specific areas of industries. But it&#8217;s also not something that is going to replace everything, where you&#8217;re going to click a button and there&#8217;s going to be a brand-new website, or there will be a replacement of all these different jobs and things, at least in my opinion. Who knows what the far-term future is going to bring? But we&#8217;re in the early days of this technology, and where it really shines is in doing things that are repetitive tasks that can&#8217;t necessarily be automated away in a traditional workflow because it needs a little more leeway, a little more room to roam. But it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s going to just completely replace everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our approach with every one of our products, we&#8217;re creating tools that users—human beings—use to make their lives easier and to cut out the annoying stuff so they can focus on the fun stuff, like designing sites and actually building out the core structures and frameworks behind these WooCommerce websites and things like that, while cutting out the annoying tasks. For me, the reason we started CodeWP was that we had built WooCommerce sites for probably about five years at that point, and there were so many little extensions that you could make to the platform with these code snippets. We had this huge library of code snippets, and every time we wanted to extend a WooCommerce site, we&#8217;d have to go find the snippet, then go to the documentation reference, then spend eight hours on Stack Overflow, then go to three GitHub issues, and try to string together the information we needed to extend this snippet to extend WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was not something that people really enjoyed doing. At least in our company, we really enjoyed thinking about how we could solve these problems. But</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the difficult research and the challenge of stringing it all together were not something we enjoyed. So that was our first approach with AI: how can we cut out these tasks that we never really liked in our agency and make it so that&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t have to focus on anymore? Obviously, someone building a WooCommerce site isn&#8217;t going to use our tool to try to cut out the developer. It doesn&#8217;t work like that. You have to really know what you&#8217;re doing to leverage AI, but it&#8217;s one of those things where it does make our lives easier and allows us to focus on more fun things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get back to what people should be aware of regarding AI and what should be debunked here, it&#8217;s not a wonder machine. It&#8217;s not something that will do everything for you, read your mind, or anything like that. I think we&#8217;re very far from that right now. What it&#8217;s used for in practical applications is just to make people&#8217;s lives easier—those who are in the trenches actually doing things and getting things done. For us, the applications are pretty pointed because that&#8217;s where AI can thrive. If you try to tackle massive tasks that require a lot of logic, creativity, and thought, it doesn&#8217;t work that way. But to enable creators, builders, and WordPress users in our approach, you can really bring value without causing issues or stepping on any toes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />You started out with this context of the agency and building WooCommerce stores, so you already had that sort of broad context. You&#8217;ve talked about repetitive tasks as a prime example of where AI can help. Would you expand on that within WooCommerce specifically? When you&#8217;ve had this service background building WooCommerce sites, and you&#8217;ve been in the product space for years now, so you have a broad context. If someone is thinking about AI within the WooCommerce context, is there anything beyond repetitive tasks, or within repetitive tasks? Can you just give us a broader perspective on where you see the opportunities for AI to be applied within WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually really excited to be on this podcast. This is something that we&#8217;ve been really focused on with our upcoming product, AgentWP. We got started with CodeWP, which is an AI code generator. We looked at how people really wanted to use this tool, and there was a lot of usage towards WooCommerce. A lot of that usage was what we had essentially built it for—extending WooCommerce with code and cutting out the research bit for these really simple implementations, making it easier to build more complex implementations with code. But there were also a lot of requests outside of what CodeWP was intended for, in terms of creating product descriptions, giving statistics, troubleshooting, and all these different things. So a lot of the usage in CodeWP led us to determine that there&#8217;s a really big opportunity here for another product. This product could be one that lives in WordPress, lives in WooCommerce, and really integrates with that individual site, database, file system, frontend, and backend to give really valuable answers to users in a more generic way—something that&#8217;s not always code, but could be, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s your error log in English,&#8221; or &#8220;Here&#8217;s a statistic about your WooCommerce store,&#8221; or anything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That research from CodeWP led to this product called AgentWP. That&#8217;s the product that goes into a WordPress site. We love WooCommerce, and we know how powerful it is, but it can also be pretty difficult to navigate sometimes and pretty complex, even as an agency, but definitely as an end user. So we&#8217;ve always, from the beginning of developing this AgentWP product, thought about how we could solve common WooCommerce problems. With this beta that we&#8217;re launching fairly soon, we came to the conclusion that WooCommerce can be extended in a few ways. Right now, the core way is statistics—really understanding your data. WooCommerce themselves have made really awesome improvements to the analytics side of things, in my opinion, transitioning from the scary Reports page to the beautiful React-based analytics page. But still, there&#8217;s so much data to sift through and even understand what it means. I think there&#8217;s a really big opportunity to have a natural language interface with your WooCommerce data and, zooming out, with all of your WordPress data as well, and leverage artificial intelligence to take a user&#8217;s request and turn it into a statistical response. That was a big focus of ours for the beta, to kind of prove out, &#8220;Okay, this product, the idea here is it lives in WordPress, leverages WordPress data, and then it uses or converts the user&#8217;s request into some form of action, response, or message in some form.&#8221; Our core implementation to solve this was with WooCommerce statistics, so users can ask anything about their store, and the agent will go and create a query on demand to get that information and then present it to the user. Then you can continue onwards and ask additional questions like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s dive into this specific product and see if we can get analytics or insights about whether we should even focus on this product based on this data compared to all the other data.&#8221; These are things that you can&#8217;t really do with charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a really big use case that we wanted to solve for, and we did. It extends out to the remainder of WordPress, but we actually started with WooCommerce because that was something that in the agency landscape, when we were building WooCommerce stores, we always found issues with. And then in terms of building WooCommerce, we always would break it. We would always try to extend it, and we&#8217;d always install a plugin and have to do our plugin check to figure out which one was conflicting. So I think there are a lot of different implementations here, but the core ones for us were statistics and troubleshooting—not in truly the code sense, but just making it easier to find problems in WooCommerce because everybody who&#8217;s built a WooCommerce store knows that you could get very complex with these things. You could legitimately have a use case for 30 plugins sometimes, 20 plugins sometimes. In my opinion, that&#8217;s very different from standard WordPress development, where you try to keep your plugins down, but with WooCommerce, it just bubbles up. So having this interface where you can use natural language to navigate around your WooCommerce site and understand what potential issues could be popping up, that was something we really wanted to focus on. All of the development here was driven by the problems we bumped into while actually building WooCommerce for years and years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />I want to expand on that a bit. So far, what I&#8217;m hearing is that there are two broad categories that you&#8217;re focused on. There&#8217;s the insights, which I think is a great example—being able to query against a large set of inputs and data to get insights for the end user. Then there&#8217;s also the repetitive tasks part. Those insights might lead to tasks to be done. I&#8217;m really curious about what I would describe as the opportunities categories. You alluded to it in terms of identifying potential problems and addressing those ahead of time, where the agent might be able to surface, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s an issue over here for you to know about.&#8221; But because WooCommerce is a subset, an ecosystem within WordPress, if someone’s in WooCommerce, there&#8217;s a lot more potential for knowing their intentions. They&#8217;re probably trying to run a business. There&#8217;s likely a commerce intention on the other side of it, whereas with WordPress, it’s a lot more generic. So I can see within the context of this product that you&#8217;re building, AgentWP, that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s WooCommerce.&#8221; How do you think about the opportunities that you have—the ability to potentially surface to an end user—since there&#8217;s a lot more that you presumably could know about their intentions and the current state? Do you see that growing into things like conversion optimization or noticing, for instance, that customers are complaining about a particular thing and being able to… It’s broad, but there’s also a lot that you could know about intention and context because it’s in Woo. How do you think about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, once you know that you&#8217;re in WooCommerce, there is a lot that you can really do for the user. Right now, the initial solution, the core idea here, was let&#8217;s just give AI safe access to the means and methods developers have always had. They can gather data, and then they can modify a WordPress or WooCommerce site using these APIs, queries, and all these different things. That was the core idea here. With the initial implementation of this agent, we started by saying, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go and approach it from a read-only standpoint, where we can gather data and then use this data to tell users more about a site, store, or product.&#8221; That in itself is really valuable and beneficial, but our real goal here is to do both sides of the coin—do read and write—where you can surface opportunities and then the agent can take action on these opportunities for a user. In my definition, an AI agent is something that leverages its own internal models to do logic and reasoning for a user to fulfill a task autonomously. Obviously, you have to build rails and guidelines to make it safe, and you have to ensure the user actually wants these actions to happen. You also have to know how to identify this. But we want to grow this into that autonomous solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you apply something like that—just the concept, not even thinking about the actual implementations—but the concept of this AI assistant within WooCommerce, specifically with access to this data and the ability to review the data for you, then the ability to give you suggestions and fulfill those suggestions, it becomes something that can be a real power multiplier for the agency building a site and the client running the site. Like you said, you can use the statistics to do synchronous reviews of your analytics, where somebody&#8217;s actually asking for a report or something and gets a report back. But you can also asynchronously review these statistics as well and identify, &#8220;Hey, here are some trends that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you aren&#8217;t even looking for that you should know about,&#8221; and &#8220;Here&#8217;s a product that&#8217;s not performing well.&#8221; By the way, we have this external data source that looks at the SEO for all of your products, and this one’s not really doing as well as all your other products in terms of rankings, keyword density, and all these different things. You can surface these opportunities in the read-only mode, but eventually, you can actually say, &#8220;Hey, can you just watch my products? And when a product starts falling in the Google rankings and when the Google Analytics metrics start dropping—the conversion analytics start dropping—can you take a look at this and see how you would improve it and then send me a message saying, &#8216;I&#8217;d improve it this way,&#8217; or actually just go and improve it? Go and update that description to fulfill those keyword requests or whatever the SEO optimization would be, or rewrite it to be better for conversions or whatever it is. Go and actually do this for me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the end goal here, where you have this system that goes through your information autonomously and really understands the purpose of your site and how your site operates in terms of, &#8220;Here are the products that this company sells, and here are the plugins that this company is using to enable subscriptions and memberships,&#8221; and all these different things. Then really use that information to create those on-demand suggestions for the user and eventually notify the user about this. The user doesn&#8217;t even have to think about, &#8220;Oh, what should I even ask this thing to do?&#8221; Eventually, if the user wants—obviously you don&#8217;t want to just have this running around willy-nilly—but if the user wants and creates these rule sets, it can go and do these optimizations, and it can eventually go and do customer support or anything like it. When you give this system access to the data and the ability to take action on that data within WooCommerce and within WordPress in general, I think it becomes a very powerful and value-added system for both the builders and the users. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really excited to be building because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working on right now, and it&#8217;s very fun to think about these problems and how you can build for our industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />So we&#8217;ve spoken a little bit about the product and how you interact with it as a user, and we also typically like to ask how you would build here. I&#8217;d like to take a little bit of a tangent on that and say, how would you build integrating artificial intelligence into products? Because we spoke specifically about tasks and taking workflows. So we talked a little bit earlier about resetting that notion of what AI is and what it isn&#8217;t—debunking a little bit. What do you think it can solve today for product makers? How do you start using it, and how do you use it in the products that you make?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I&#8217;ll mention a couple of implementations that make sense and how we would go about doing it. The first thing is I don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re a product builder, you should just go and say, &#8220;Hey, we need AI. Let&#8217;s go figure out how we can add AI to our products and have a sparkly AI button in all our tools.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case because AI, like we said in the beginning, doesn&#8217;t do everything, and it only does a few things very well. To do those few things very well, it has to be very mindfully implemented. You have to really think about how you’re going to, number one, gather the information necessary for these models to actually create something that offers the user value, instead of just garbage input, garbage output, or something that somebody sees but never actually uses. There has to be a very mindful implementation of the solution, and then there also has to be a very thoughtful way you actually implement it. So it has to offer the user value, and then you actually have to implement it so it does offer that user value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of products, I wouldn&#8217;t just completely pivot every product to say, &#8220;Oh, we must have AI now.&#8221; But I do think there are some really low-lift tasks for many plugins that can use AI in the statistics and in the generation capabilities. We actually see this with a lot of WordPress plugins nowadays. I just saw on X yesterday that Monster Insights added a Google Analytics AI chat where you can discuss your analytics. That solves a pain point. That’s something that takes data and makes it accessible to users, and it&#8217;s not this huge AI implementation where now we&#8217;re AI analytics and now we do everything, but we offer this helpful conversational interface to go and fulfill something that has been a pain point for users. GA4—nobody knows how to use this thing. It&#8217;s the most complex interface ever, so let&#8217;s go and simplify it. I think that&#8217;s a good implementation, and I think there are a lot of other products that have these pain points that could be solved with this open-ended conversational interaction with their product, but not actually going and saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go make everything AI, and you&#8217;re going to have to use conversational interactions for everything. There’s not going to be a &#8216;New Product&#8217; button in WooCommerce now; it&#8217;s going to be &#8216;Make Product with AI.\'&#8221; That&#8217;s not the right way. But adding these little implementations, leveraging AI, and not going crazy and training your own models and building these data pipelines— which is something that we&#8217;re doing, but you don&#8217;t need to do that—you can use the generative AI capabilities off the shelf and build out these small implementations that solve user pain points that couldn&#8217;t necessarily be solved in another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think another good example, not WooCommerce specific, is WSForm by Mark Westguard. It was one of the first form builders to implement anything AI-related, and it wasn&#8217;t this thing where every single input field and every single thing had this AI wizard and this &#8220;Generate with AI&#8221; button. But there was a very simple flow where, if you want to go and build out a form and you don&#8217;t know exactly what fields you want, but you know your concept—&#8221;I need this form to accept reservations for this specific restaurant&#8221;—you could type it into this natural language input box, and it would just convert that natural language into the underlying JSON structure of the form builder. Just a simple implementation, something that solves these problems, doesn&#8217;t replace the way the actual product works, but just augments it. I think there are many products in WordPress that can mindfully implement things like that, and that&#8217;s the approach I think every company should take with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because it exists doesn&#8217;t mean you need it. There are many cases where it&#8217;s actually probably better not to have it, but there are also many cases where there are these small pain points like, &#8220;I need form inspiration,&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what fields I should add,&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to make sense of these big massive reports,&#8221; where a simple implementation that complements the existing product, instead of taking the product over, can offer people value. In terms of products, that&#8217;s the way to think about AI, especially with existing products. When it&#8217;s a new product, I think it&#8217;s a bit of a different approach, but with existing ones, you have the data, you know what your users want, and you can mindfully say, &#8220;Yeah, we should implement AI,&#8221; or &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t implement AI.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one thing. The other thing is actually building the AI. With all of the solutions that I&#8217;ve talked about, off-the-shelf frontier large language models are usually all you need to add this feature, and they&#8217;re very easy to implement. But they become very difficult to implement when you try to solve these crazy, wicked use cases that are pushing the boundaries and something that somebody else hasn&#8217;t done before—something that&#8217;s not as simple as input-output. When you start getting very complex, then you have to start thinking about what else goes around the mindful implementation of AI. For us, with this agent product, we are trying to do a lot, and it&#8217;s kind of the complete opposite of what I just said with the mindful implementation of specific cases in AI for existing products. Our approach is to mindfully implement some AI capabilities with statistics and generations, and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you build a system that has a much bigger scope, there are many more edge cases, many more things that can go wrong, and there&#8217;s a lot more complexity in the underlying systems to actually enable these things. For example, navigation on WordPress, fulfilling tasks and actions for users. When you do that type of stuff, then you have to think about, &#8220;Okay, maybe we could technically build this, and maybe it&#8217;s wildly complex, but is this something that can be done safely 100% of the time? Can we catch errors before they&#8217;re introduced to a WordPress site? How do we actually steer the behavior of these models?&#8221; For us, it’s like we have to build out these humongous datasets and these massive databases, and then train the behavior into models and build out pipelines and things like that. So mindfully implementing AI and doing it in a safe, thoughtful, and effective manner, when you get complex, is another thing that you really have to consider. For the products that already exist, I really think thoughtful implementation of small AI features that are pretty simple but solve those pain points is the way to go, and from the tech side, it’s fairly easy. If you want to get crazy complex, you can probably build a really cool product out of it, but there are a lot more things that come with it in terms of being safe, being thoughtful, and doing it so your users are not negatively impacted by that implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />You&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times the word &#8220;trust,&#8221; and I&#8217;d like to just dig into that. Sometimes AI can feel unexpected to people, and sometimes things can feel… How do you build trust into AI? Let&#8217;s take an existing product that doesn&#8217;t have AI and you want to start implementing it. You have a good reason to implement it. How do</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you look at building trust with that user base? What is your advice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Wild transparency as the company. If you&#8217;re the company, you need the most transparent approach to this possible. You have to explain, &#8220;Here’s what we&#8217;re using your input to actually do, and here’s how we&#8217;re actually doing it, and here’s the additional information we&#8217;re taking from this site or this plugin, and here’s all of that data that&#8217;s going to this specific provider, and here’s our agreement with this specific provider, this data processor, and here’s how they use it. They don&#8217;t store it on their servers; we have this agreement. They&#8217;re not going to use it to train their big models.&#8221; Then when the data comes back, &#8220;Here’s how it&#8217;s used in your WordPress site, and here’s what you can expect from input to output, and there’s going to be no deviations because we&#8217;ve built these safe systems to ensure that this is what happens with this user input and with this data.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the smallest scale and the biggest scale, being really upfront about how data is used, and then how the actual interaction with this AI will be used is really important. Also explaining—because for 99% of these implementations, it&#8217;s using a big AI provider like Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, or any one of these—explaining, &#8220;Here are the actual processors, and we have this enterprise agreement with OpenAI, so they&#8217;re not going to use data to train and they don&#8217;t retain this, and here are all of these policies.&#8221; I actually really like the… I don&#8217;t know if it’s true regulation around this, but the aspect of always being upfront with your data subprocessors, and actually taking that step further and explaining, &#8220;Here’s how the data is gathered, here’s how it&#8217;s used, here are the structures, and here are the pipelines.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us with the agent product, that’s something that when we launch, it&#8217;s going to be very clear: &#8220;Here’s the data that&#8217;s used. Here are the processors that are using this data, here’s what comes back, here’s what’s expected.&#8221; For us, it&#8217;s a bit more open-ended, so there’s a lot of user consent during interactions with our product—actually being asked, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to take this action. Do you want to take this action? Here’s what this action will do. Here’s how we got to actually creating this action.&#8221; For statistics, &#8220;Here’s the exact query we ran.&#8221; So if you want, you can go and get the data yourself and verify this, and give users the tools and essentially the transparency behind anything in AI. I think that’s the way you build trust. Also, build systems so you don’t make massive mistakes. There’s never an opportunity for a system to… I don’t think any system’s ever going to go haywire and say, &#8220;I don’t like this WooCommerce site; I’m going to completely rewrite it.&#8221; But I think there are cases where the AI can get misaligned, and it can go and take the wrong action, which could be destructive to a site. So building systems to catch some issue before it ever happens, having the user consent so they know what’s happening, know what’s gone into this action and what this action will actually do, and worst case, if a negative action actually happens, having rollbacks, having backups, having easy ways to undo something that was autonomously or synchronously taken by a system, that’s another really important thing. So I think transparency and then actually thinking about real users who are going to use this, so we have to build these systems that don’t just go and do it 95% accurately, but also cover the other 5%, which will come from AI, but make sure we handle it gracefully and properly to create a really good product that people do trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I know AgentWP&#8221; or &#8220;I know this statistics solution,&#8221; or &#8220;I know this form builder does exactly this with exactly this data, with exactly these processors.&#8221; In the form of some input-output, &#8220;Here’s the source of that output,&#8221; and in the form of actions, &#8220;Here’s the action that’s going to be taken, here’s why it’s going to be taken, here’s what it will result in.&#8221; Worst case, we have robust rollback tools to go and undo something if it wasn’t what you really wanted. That’s the approach, I think, for any AI product. Just be upfront; don’t just add some AI bubble and don’t tell users what data you’re taking or start taking users’ data without their consent. Just be mindful and be an ethical product creator. I think that the trust should naturally come because you deserve that trust because you’re somebody that does it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Yeah, you put in the work for it. James, you&#8217;ve got an interesting background. You started out with the agency, you’ve also been in the venture-backed startup. With WPAI, you&#8217;ve also raised money, and you&#8217;re raising more. What I&#8217;m curious about is that the venture-backed startup was outside of the WordPress space. You came back into WordPress; you gave us some sort of clues already for that, but I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what, for you as an entrepreneur and for other builders listening in the space, what&#8217;s some of the value that you see in the WordPress ecosystem? Because there&#8217;s a lot of risk with starting a business. There’s a lot that goes into it. You and the team have been putting a bunch of work into this. Where does your confidence come from that investing into the WordPress WooCommerce space makes sense? Why do you stay in this ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, I grew up in this ecosystem, so I know how big it is, and I know how far-reaching it is. When I speak with other founders, investors, and people in the startup world—and we truly are a startup, I think in the truest sense of the word startup, we’re an early-stage company that’s really pushing the boundaries in our industry with new technology—when I speak with other people in similar positions in different industries, they sometimes know what WordPress is. Sometimes they don’t even know what it is, and when they do know what it is, they don’t realize the extent of the industry. Being able to grow up in WordPress and realize, &#8220;Hey, we’ve done projects that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and have done hundreds of millions of dollars of sales through them,&#8221; you really understand from the ground floor how big the economic impact of WordPress and WooCommerce is. Then when you look at, &#8220;Oh, WordPress powers half the internet, and the nearest competitor is this massive multi-billion dollar public company that has only a few percentage points of the industry,&#8221; it’s really one of those industries that I don’t think many people realize how big it is. I think you kind of have to start from within WordPress to even understand how big it is. Once you understand how big it is, there’s so much opportunity to disrupt WordPress in a positive way and bring these modern technologies and solutions from the startup landscape into WordPress to really offer valuable products to the biggest cohort of internet creators in the entire world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me as a founder, it was always very clear that this is an industry that’s really big. It’s always going to be underserved. It’s always going to be something that I think if you want to build a really disruptive and valuable product, you can, but you have to know the industry to be able to do that. You have to understand the pain points behind what goes into building sites and using WordPress. Just be from it. That’s what brought me back to WordPress because I saw and I had the opportunity to go really do whatever I wanted and build whatever product I wanted and serve whatever industry I wanted. I had the opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, I think that this AI stuff will be very valuable in the near and long-term future. I can see in my brain exactly how this thing can be implemented on both a small scale but also a really big scale in WordPress, in WooCommerce, in these ecosystems, so I’m going to go and do it.&#8221; That was my approach there, and that’s why I got back into the WordPress industry. But I think it’s just really understated how big this industry is and how much capital moves around in WordPress and is connected to WordPress. When you look at the competition, it’s much more flashy and snazzy, and that’s why everybody goes down that route. But it’s not as big as WordPress, and it’s not as economically impactful as WordPress. There are true needs here, and if you can identify those needs and ideally build a valuable product that serves those needs—in our case, that’s trying to solve a lot of the pain points with AI specifically—I think you can build an unbelievably valuable company in this industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />James, if someone is looking to come into this space, maybe they see this opportunity, but they don’t have that background, what’s one piece of guidance that you’d give to an entrepreneur? Let’s say they want to build a WooCommerce-centric product. What guidance would you give them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />If you’re from the industry or if you’re not from the industry, I think the only way to build any product—and it gets even more important with WooCommerce and WordPress—is to talk to the people who will buy the product. That’s something that a lot of founders don’t do, where they just have a cool idea and go build it and hope for the best. But specifically with WooCommerce, you can find a WooCommerce store, you can find the people who built that store, you can find the people who run that store, and you can just go to them and send them an email and say, &#8220;Hey, give me five minutes of your time, please. I really want to talk about</p>\n\n\n\n<p>this potential problem that you very likely have that’s probably costing you a lot of time and a lot of gray hair, and I’m trying to build something to solve it. If I solve it, you’re going to benefit from it, so please talk to me.&#8221; People will speak with you, and they will spill all of their problems. Specifically with WooCommerce, I see because it’s a very scoped ecosystem, you could build anything, but it’s pretty scoped. People all have the same problems, and they all bump into the same problems doing the same things, and that’s where you can build valuable products—you can solve those problems. Those problems are surfaced by speaking with people. That goes for any company, but I think WooCommerce and WordPress specifically—so many people use it. They spend 12 hours a day using these products, building for them, using them as the end users, and they all have the same problems. They’ll all tell you the problems because they want you to solve them. It’s very approachable to go and figure out, &#8220;Okay, these hundred WooCommerce sites exist, and I’m just going to go email their contact email and say, &#8216;I’m building this product, and it might help you. Give me five minutes.\'&#8221; A lot of people will, and you’ll also get nos, but that’s part of the process of building a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speak with people who actually want to use your products, and you’ll find these common threads, and you’ll find where you could build valuable tools, and then you go and do it. Then you go right back to them and say, &#8220;Hey, remember that thing that you said cost you $5,000 a month? I just built something, and it will fix that for you, and there’s your value.&#8221; That’s been my approach with any product, and specifically with the AgentWP product. What are specific areas that we can solve with this type of interface, and how can we do it in a way that’s valuable for you? We find these really common pain points that can be solved in this specific way, and then we build for it. Ideally, we’ll be able to launch the core product that solves a lot of these problems and then continue to, one after another, cross off problems from this list and offer the solution for it. But the only way we know these problems is by talking with these people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />As we wrap, I want us to move a little bit to the future. We can move as far ahead into the future as you want to, but where do you see all these advances with artificial intelligence going in the future? What are the possibilities you see, or hope for even?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, I hope that AI makes human creativity more valuable. I think we’ve already kind of seen that. I remember back in 2022 when the first AI craze was really popping up. It was something that everybody was horrified that it was going to replace art and replace human thought and all these different things. Obviously, I think there are risks there, but I also think that it’s serving to make the human aspect of creating a lot more important. So I think there will be disruption, and I think that we really have to… You can’t just stick your head into a hole and pretend and hope that it all goes away. I think things will change, but I think ideally, my vision for the future and the products that we’re building are products that enable the meaningful part of that work to be automated away and then really make the human aspect of it—specifically for me, like in agency and building WooCommerce stores—the things I loved were thinking about how we could design things and create these brands and this copy and these various elements of your store to make it convert for the users. So I hope that type of human interaction and the consulting, strategic, and thought parts really shine with AI and aren’t replaced. I think that is something that I’m already seeing a lot of people kind of going like, &#8220;Hey, AI is great, but it’s not a good artist, and it’s not a good copywriter. If you have 20 AI sites that all have the same copy, it all reads the same, it’s all the same mush.&#8221; I do hope and think that AI will surface the need for that human level of creativity and human level of interaction in web design and creation, but in everything, I think in every industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s my hope for the future, and I do think that’s something that will be the case. I’m always a glass-half-full person, but I do think that’s something that will be the case. For us in WordPress, we’re trying to build those products that do make it easier for the builders of the sites to build the sites and to focus on the fun things, and to leverage these tools to better support their clients and to have their clients use these tools to get rid of those annoying 2 a.m. &#8220;make the logo bigger&#8221; requests. That’s our approach with everything, and I think in the future, you can’t just expect AI to disappear because I think it is a disruptor and I think it will change a lot of different things. But I also think that it’s a lot brighter future with AI tools and with these platforms to allow you as the creator to really focus on the creation and the architecture of a specific functionality or change, and the copy, branding, and human illustrations. I think that’s something that will be really important in the future. That’s what we’re trying to build towards. That’s what I’m hoping for in the future. That’s what I’m seeing early whispers of online and in digital media. &#8220;Hey, AI is good, but it spits out the same meaningless mush, so let’s not use it for that. Let’s use it to get rid of the annoying stuff and then focus on the fun stuff.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />You touched a little bit on fears, but you also mentioned your glass is half-full. So what are your biggest fears for open source and WordPress through the lens of AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think if you really want to take the horrifying view, you can see a future where a lot of creativity is just sapped away and replaced with meaningless mush sites, meaningless nonsense garbage content creation, and AI images that are all uncanny and look the same. I think that could happen if we allow it, but luckily I think the WordPress industry is kind of taking the charge on this with Matt’s focus on, &#8220;Hey, a WordPress site, an individual’s website, could become that individual&#8217;s expression of themselves online.&#8221; Especially in the future, it could become what it was like back in the day when a personal website was a way to express oneself. I think that’s something that it could grow back into. But I do think as an industry, we really have to be thoughtful and considerate of, &#8220;Hey, we don’t want mushy AI sites and mushy content and mushy images, where we can’t understand what’s human and what’s AI creations in the future.&#8221; I think the easy way to fix that is to just say, &#8220;Hey, let’s not do that. Let’s build products that enable us rather than replace us, and let’s go and really create meaningful human-like interactions online to show, &#8216;Here’s why you actually want this. Here’s an AI site, and here’s my site, and my site’s a million times better than this AI site.\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s my approach, and I know I flipped it again into that glass-half-full approach, but that’s really something I think you have to do. You have to be excited about the future because it’s coming, and if you’re not excited about it and you just try to sit it out and pretend it’s all going to go away, it’s going to run you over, and it’s probably going to create the future that you don’t want. So for me, it’s like, &#8220;Hey, let’s build these products that do the things that we do want them to do and enable the things that we do want to be enabled, rather than let somebody else build a product that replaces me, or let somebody else build a website that is this mushy site when it could have been this human site, and now these clients don’t realize the value of what I could do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think you have to be mindful about what could happen, but I already see a lot in the Facebook groups, on Twitter, and in the social ecosystem of WordPress. I think people are really mindful of that, and if we try to build the future we want, it will likely be the future that we want. So I’m glad that’s already happening, and I think that will continue to happen into the future. Obviously, I’ll try to be one of the leaders in the WordPress space to go and build that future that we all want and build the tools that are valuable and helpful to everybody, not replacements or anything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />James, I appreciate the care that you and the team have been putting into just thinking through things. There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes. I know that’s something I’ve appreciated as I’ve been following along with what you’ve been doing. There’s a lot that goes into it to create those rails, to think about trust and safety, and I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to seeing how the next couple of months and years pan out. It’s great to have you in the ecosystem. You’re going to be at WordCamp US with us all in not too many weeks from now. If someone wants to reach out, how can people best get in contact with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, if you want to reach out, I would actually love to meet people in person at WordCamp. I always see people online, and it’s really fun to meet people in person. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>find me on Twitter/X at @JamesWLaPage. You can send me a DM; the DMs are open. At WordCamp US and at any of the other events we go to—because we go to a lot of them now—if you see a tall, skinny dude wearing a WPAI hat, it is likely me, so come and approach me. I absolutely love being approached and just speaking with people and saying hello, so do that as well. But for any questions, ideas, partnerships, whatever, feel free to DM me on X. I’m always receptive there and would love to take the conversation a bit further. That’s what I do. I talk about AI, and I talk about WordPress. So love doing that. Don’t hesitate to DM me or say hello in person. I love seeing people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan:<br />Excellent. Thank you, James. Talk to you soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie:<br />Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo ProductChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Jonathan Wold</strong> and T<strong>ammie Lister</strong> are joined by <strong>James LePage, founder of WPAI</strong>, to chat about the intersection of AI, eCommerce, and WooCommerce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>James shares his journey from running a WordPress agency to focusing on AI-driven products, highlighting the challenges and opportunities AI presents in the WooCommerce space. He emphasizes the importance of mindful AI implementation to enhance, rather than replace, human creativity and tasks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touches on the future of AI in WordPress, the need for transparency and trust in AI tools, and the potential for AI to streamline processes while preserving the value of human input in web development and eCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Service and Product</strong>: James LePage transitioned from running a WordPress agency to developing AI-driven products, motivated by the desire to focus on building tools rather than managing client relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI’s Role in WooCommerce</strong>: AI can significantly enhance the WooCommerce experience by automating repetitive tasks, providing valuable insights, and improving site performance, but it should be implemented thoughtfully to ensure it complements human creativity and decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mindful AI Implementation</strong>: The success of AI in WordPress products depends on careful, transparent implementation that addresses specific pain points without overwhelming or replacing the user’s role. Trust is built through clear communication about how AI processes data and interacts with sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Opportunities in WooCommerce</strong>: AI has the potential to identify trends, optimize conversions, and offer proactive solutions within WooCommerce sites, making it a powerful tool for both developers and business owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Future of AI in WordPress</strong>: James envisions a future where AI tools enable creators to focus on meaningful, creative work by automating the less enjoyable tasks. However, there’s a need to avoid a future dominated by generic, AI-generated content that lacks human touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparency and Trust in AI</strong>: Building user trust in AI tools requires transparency about how data is used and processed, along with safeguards to ensure AI actions are safe and reversible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Value of the WordPress Ecosystem</strong>: Despite the risks of starting a business, the vast and economically impactful WordPress ecosystem offers significant opportunities for building valuable products that address real user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameswlepage/\">James on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/jameswlepage\">James on X</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpai.co/\">WPAI.co</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 09:06:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Gary: Four Thousand, Five Hundred and Forty-Eight Days\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=5579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://pento.net/2024/08/20/four-thousand-five-hundred-and-forty-eight-days/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2861:\"<p>Nearly 15 years ago, I emailed the 20-something-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">a little tech startup with a weird name</a>. As I recall, there were maybe 20 or so people doing WordPress-y things there at the time. I started doing a bit of contract work (the hiring process wasn’t as organised back then as it is today!) and, a couple of years after that, signed up full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 12 years later, that weird little startup has grown into a big company. It does a whole lot more than just WordPress, and it&#8217;s been a spectacular ride to get here. I&#8217;ve seen tiny little experiments and hacks grow up to be hugely popular products; I&#8217;ve worked with some of the smartest and most talented people I’ve ever met; and I even got to help lead WordPress development for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, I&#8217;ve travelled around the world multiple times, meeting thousands of folks in the WordPress community, in countless cities. We’ve built stuff together that’s been used by hundreds of millions of people and viewed by billions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, there are very few parts of Automattic that I hadn’t at least dipped my toes into. I&#8217;m extremely proud of everything I accomplished there, but it also gave me the sense that I’d finally reached the end of what there was for me to work on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, a few months ago, I decided it was time for me to go exploring for new challenges. I finished up and have since been enjoying some time off, barely touching my computer. I&#8217;ve done a bit of gardening, ticked a lot of things off my to-do list around the house, and I&#8217;ve been truly able to relax for a good while.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, though, I&#8217;m refreshed and ready to set off on my next adventure. This is where you come in, dear reader! Perhaps you&#8217;re looking for a tech lead to help scale your startup. Maybe you&#8217;re looking for someone with extensive experience not just with WordPress, but with the entire WordPress ecosystem and community. You could be a larger company looking for a principal engineer to inspire cross-divisional collaboration, or tackle the technical debt that inevitably builds up over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those aren&#8217;t the only options, of course, but maybe they give you an idea of where I can help. If you have a role you think I&#8217;d be the perfect fit for, let&#8217;s chat about it! You can reach out to me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-pendergast/\">LinkedIn</a>, or email me directly at gary@pento.net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you happen to work at a company that you think I should join, let me know in the comments, or drop me a message.

This will be the third and final WordPress release of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.7 Release Squad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, Matt Mullenweg leads the release, with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidbaumwald/\">David Baumwald</a> serving as the Release Coordinator. The Core Tech Leads are <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/peterwilsoncc/\">Peter Wilson</a> (sponsored by 10up) and&nbsp; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kirasong/\">Kira Schroder</a> (sponsored by GoDaddy). The squad also includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Editor Tech Leads: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/noisysocks/\">Robert Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kevin940726/\">Kai Hao</a> (Both from Automattic)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Core Triage Leads: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chaion07/\">Ahmed Kabir Chaion</a>, (Zone7) <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/stoyangeorgiev/\">Stoyan Georgiev</a> (SiteGround)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor Triage Leads: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ndiego/\">Nick Diego</a> (Automattic), <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/colorful-tones/\">Damon Cook</a> (WP Engine)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Documentation Leads: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fabiankaegy/\">Fabian Kägy</a> (10up), <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/faguni22/\">Mumtahina Faguni</a> (WPDeveloper)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Test Lead: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ankit-k-gupta/\">Ankit K.

Feedback received indicates this is particularly constraining for the Default Theme Role, for which the leads had to start the work before this announcement to avoid getting caught by the release deadlines.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, he suggested two solutions: providing weekly updates on the release squad and making an early call for volunteers for the default theme separate from the release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Five</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The default theme for WordPress 6.7 will be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/introducing-twenty-twenty-five/\">Twenty Twenty-Five</a>. In the words of the Theme Design Lead Beatriz Fialho, “Twenty Twenty-Five embodies ultimate flexibility and adaptability, showcasing the many ways WordPress enables people to tell their stories with many patterns and styles to choose from. The glimpses of natural beauty and ancestry woven into the theme evoke ideas of impermanence, the passage of time, and continuous evolution.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress turned 21 in May, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/05/wp21/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> shared eleven points for building WordPress with the first point being, &#8220;Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.&#8221; The design team is building the default theme based on this principle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like its predecessor, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, Twenty Twenty-Five will also be fully compatible with the Site Editor and will utilize the new design tools, such as the Grid block and Pattern/Section Styles. The theme includes templates for personal blogs, photo blogs and complex blogs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The demo content imagery, all from the Public Domain, carries a poetic, universal, and ubiquitous tone that complements the core concept. There was an opportunity to visually lean into a positive tone to bring softness, lightness, and inspiration through its aesthetic.” Beatriz Fialho continued. She also shared the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/design/dzGCSntVch4EQdVERTqyVK/Twenty-Twenty-Five?node-id=16-14852\">Figma designs</a> for the theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing the theme&#8217;s global audience, the design team prioritized high-quality fonts that support multiple languages and included a set of diverse color palettes as style variations to offer more customization options. The theme also features a broad range of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested can follow the theme&#8217;s development on the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/twentytwentyfive\">Twenty Twenty-Five GitHub repository</a> or join the weekly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/join/\">Slack</a> meetings in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-themes/\">#core-themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community&#8217;s responses included “It looks so beautiful,” “Absolutely beautiful work,” and “The next best default WordPress theme.” Some wondered why WordPress chooses a new default theme every year instead of improving the existing one. If you, too, are wondering the same, Knut Sparhell elaborated: “The latest default theme has always strived to use, and demonstrate the use of, the latest core features. Earlier themes can not just be updated with everything, as they should continue to work even with older core versions. This could be solved by upgrade requirements for the WP version, but then those left out would not get security and bug fixes, and some minor enhancements. One can look at the yearly new default block theme as an upgrade to the previous.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 05:10:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: Wordfence Launches WordPress Superhero Challenge with Big Rewards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=159393\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/wordfence-launches-wordpress-superhero-challenge-with-big-rewards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3697:\"<p>Wordfence has introduced an exciting new initiative, the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/08/earn-up-to-31200-per-vulnerability-introducing-the-wordpress-bug-bounty-superhero-challenge/\">WordPress Superhero Challenge</a>, as part of its ongoing Bug Bounty Program. Running until October 14th, this challenge exclusively targets plugins and themes with over 5 million active installations, a category that demands a high level of expertise due to the extensive testing these products undergo before reaching production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chloe Chamberland, the Threat Intelligence Lead at Wordfence, explained, “By running this challenge, we want to supercharge the amount of research going into these extremely popular products, thereby improving the security of hundreds of millions of visitors to sites with these products installed.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence is tripling the current top bounty amounts, with the top bounty prize being an impressive $31,200. “By funding more vulnerability research than any other organization and releasing vulnerabilities to the community in a timely fashion, we further our mission of securing the Web.”, said Chloe.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpNyO_wrF8VgqY6bSumu31LKSjNHkIaqLQCNLioqreZIaQtm0sDr8PuOkHTXIkYwG427JYJyKoMz-VDMJ34c8rKgWpIHaeOSVyDlsvVGiPs3lPNvqed6JPTOxazxUlyUIReyRDwJCbfLUPYFmu_8dZbp8?key=hwib0ae8-8CpASIHsEFLEQ\" alt=\"List of some bounty reward possibilities during the Superhero Challenge\" /><strong>List of some bounty reward possibilities during the Superhero Challenge</strong>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the bounty prize, researchers who discover and report critical or high-severity vulnerabilities in plugins or themes with 5 million+ active installs will be awarded a special &#8220;WordPress Superhero&#8221; badge, marking their exceptional contribution to WordPress security. The repository has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/\">10 plugins</a> with over five million active installations but no themes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bug bounty program excludes products of some companies, such as Google, Brainstorm Force, Automattic, and Siteground, as they have their own reward programs in place. The <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/bug-bounty-program/\">Wordfence website</a> has more details about the program guidelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence launched the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordfence-launches-bug-bounty-program\">Bug Bounty Program</a> in November 2023 to reward researchers for finding vulnerabilities and disclosing them privately. The company rewards the researchers based on active install counts, the criticality of the vulnerability, the ease of exploitation, and the prevalence of the vulnerability type and has spent over $300,000 in bounties since 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress, with its impressive market share of over 43% of the internet, needs researchers to make it secure. Last month, Patchstack, another popular web security name, launched <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/academy/welcome/\">Patchstack Academy</a> and doubled its monthly <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/biggest-wordpress-bug-bounty-program-upgrade-is-here/\">competition bounties</a>. Their Zeroday program now offers researchers bounties ranging from $150 to $14,400, depending on the access level required to exploit the reported vulnerability. Reporting vulnerabilities in plugins/themes with over 5 million installs will net researchers a bounty of $7,200 or $14,400.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the world facing several security nightmares recently, including the Cloudstrike fiasco, it is great to see security being given more attention in the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 09:12:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 19.0 Introduces Two New Experimental Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=159341\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-19-0-introduces-two-new-experimental-features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1982:\"<p>Gutenberg 19.0 has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-19-0-14-august/\">arrived</a> with two exciting experimental features, along with various feature enhancements and bug fixes. The Gutenberg team is actively seeking user feedback on these experimental additions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first experimental feature is the highly anticipated UI prototype for connecting blocks and custom fields. To try it out, you can enable the “UI to create block bindings” experiment by navigating to Gutenberg &gt; Experiments. Automattician Jorge Costa, sponsored by Automattic, has shared a video in the release post that explains this feature in detail.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The second experimental feature in Gutenberg 19.0 is the Quick Edit functionality within the new Pages interface. Built using Data Views, this feature supports bulk editing, allowing users to make quick adjustments to multiple fields without leaving the Pages interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both these features are available under the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64121\">experimental blocks flag</a> and can be accessed from Gutenberg &gt; Experiments in the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also brings a more intuitive user interface for configuring views such as pages, templates, and patterns. Users can now decide if filters should be displayed by default or hidden, and they can easily add them back with a click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable features include a zoomed-out view alongside the device preview options, multiple writing flow enhancements, improved zoom transition between devices, and a new “send” icon. Gutenberg 19.0 also fixes a layout issue in the document bar, adds react peer dependency to the <code>@wordpress/primitives</code> package, and increases the minimum required WordPress version to 6.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorge Costa&#8217;s release post gives the full list of bug fixes, enhancements, and other improvements in this release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 13:19:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Do The Woo Community: Balancing Careers and Agency Evolution with Joe Riviello\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/balancing-careers-and-agency-evolution-with-joe-riviello/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32599:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-17 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-16 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-15 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-7 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-14 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"600\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GoDaddy-square.png?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"GoDaddy\" class=\"wp-image-75131\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-8\"> <strong><a href=\"https://godaddy.com\">GoDaddy</a></strong>: Build your clients sites using the flexibility of a <strong>Managed WooCommerce Store from GoDaddy</strong>.

I&#8217;m here today, Robbie Adair, to do an episode of the Woo Agency Chat. I&#8217;ve got Robert here with me, my fellow co-host. Robert, how are things going on your side of the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s August, and it should be so nice and quiet and peaceful, but I think everyone is still running around at a thousand miles an hour. We&#8217;ve got WordCamp US coming up, just in about four weeks. I know plenty of folks are busy with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Oh my goodness, I didn&#8217;t realize how close it is. Yes, I think I&#8217;ve got like four trips before that, but yay, WordCamp US!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Maybe you can get out to Scranton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />That&#8217;s right. So yeah, today we have Zen Agency with us, Joe Riviello. See, I told you I was going to mess it up, Joe. I knew it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Joe Riviello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, so we were actually chatting with Joe before we started our show today, and we&#8217;ve got an interesting one here for you guys because Joe works on people&#8217;s hearts in the morning and then their websites in the afternoon. I love it. Joe, tell us about Zen Agency and how you got started in this when you were a heart surgeon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Yep. So it actually started back in the nineties. I was in cardiovascular perfusion school at Hahnemann University, which is in Philadelphia, and my background is in cardiovascular perfusion. What that means is we operate the heart-lung machine during open heart surgery. I still do that today. I run the agency, and I&#8217;m in surgery in the mornings. By the afternoon, I&#8217;m running my agency. So anyway, the way it all came about, my grandfather, back in the nineties, had open heart surgery, and we were in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Back then, if you needed open heart surgery, you didn&#8217;t get it in Scranton, Pennsylvania; you went to Philadelphia for surgery. So he was in Philadelphia at Hahnemann, and I went to visit him. I was really undecided about what I wanted to do with my life at that time. So I visited him, and I was sitting bedside with him, and this was about 1993-ish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a catalog sitting next to him, and it was a catalog from the school, open to the cardiovascular perfusion technology program at Hahnemann University. So I looked into it and thought, &#8220;Well, this looks really interesting.&#8221; I was kind of techy back then, as techy as you could be because we weren&#8217;t really in a technological revolution yet. But anyway, I got into perfusion school, and during that time, one of my classmates had a Jeep, and he was selling it. This was when Amazon and E-Trade were just starting because we were looking at penny stocks and stuff with those. But anyway, he wanted to sell his Jeep, and I said, &#8220;You know what? Let&#8217;s try to build a website and raffle the Jeep off.&#8221; Well, little did I realize back then that raffling a Jeep off online is essentially gambling, which is illegal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we nixed that idea when we found out the legalities of it. But that kind of got me digging into the whole web design thing because we were trying to make a webpage back then. This was towards the late nineties when I was in school. So anyway, I graduated from perfusion school and took my first job in Las Vegas. I drove out to Las Vegas and got hired by a great company back then, and they were building an intranet and were looking for volunteers to help build it. I could not build an intranet; I was more like a static webpage Dreamweaver type of guy back then. So I raised my hand and said, &#8220;Yeah, I can do that.&#8221; So I got involved in that, and I was part of that process. Then that led to some of my friends forming a company because one of my friends was a casino host in Las Vegas, and I started a company called OwnYourOwnCasino.com, and we linked up with another company that was basically an affiliate type of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that went nowhere. A few years later, I moved back to Scranton, Pennsylvania. There was an opening at the local hospital here, which I took, and I wanted something more. I wanted to be more of an entrepreneur than an employee, so I was kind of using that as my stepping stone. I got involved with one of my good friends who&#8217;s a real estate developer and owns several businesses in our area. He said, &#8220;You&#8217;re really into this whole tech thing with the web design and everything. Why don&#8217;t you just get that started, and I&#8217;ll give you a couple of my companies to build websites for?&#8221; So I did that, and it was kind of like a hobby back then, and it remained a hobby for several years. Then I opened a cafe, and maybe a year went by after the cafe failed miserably, and I thought, &#8220;I have to do something else. I want to do something else other than just cardiovascular perfusion.&#8221; Not that it&#8217;s not a really gratifying job because it is, but I just had this entrepreneurial spirit from when I was a kid selling produce. I had a produce stand back then, which is a whole other story, but it goes back that far. So I started this company, Zen Agency, and I think back then it was called &#8220;For the Zen of It.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what that meant, but that&#8217;s what it was. It was just basically static webpages for local businesses. It wasn&#8217;t really an official company because it was just myself doing the actual work, and I was doing it from my home. After my job, I&#8217;d come home and work on my friend&#8217;s projects, who was the real estate developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing led to another. I made some money from that. I didn’t need that money because I had the hospital work, so I just rolled it into my first hire, who’s still with us to this day: Samantha Irving. She&#8217;s a great employee, and she pretty much handles all our support. So anyway, I started the company with one employee, along with my wife. I’ve got to mention my wife, Tina. She started the company with me, and we were just working out of our house. Then we moved into an office, got a few more projects under our belt, and that snowballed into more projects. We hired a few more people, and all the while, I&#8217;ve not taken a paycheck because I have my pay coming in from the hospital. So I really wasn&#8217;t concerned about taking a paycheck from Zen. Instead, I found myself putting money into Zen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, years later, we’re talking 2000-teens, we have a vibrant company. We were just dabbling into e-commerce. We weren&#8217;t in WooCommerce at first; our first framework was OS Commerce, which was a complete nightmare, and that kind of drove us into the whole WooCommerce realm. But anyway, along the way, I’ve really never taken a paycheck. I’ve always just put the money back into the agency and kept growing it that way. We went from static website design to static website design and marketing. Then we really got into the e-commerce component of it, and now we’re getting into the whole AI component. Now I’m finally taking—not a paycheck, but I&#8217;ll call them bonuses—but I&#8217;m still keeping my job in cardiovascular perfusion at the hospital. I do surgery in the morning, usually at seven o’clock. If I’m on call, you&#8217;re called in, and it could happen anytime. That’s usually one week out of every five weeks. But other than that, it’s usually a morning gig, and I work at Zen in the afternoons. Even after all these years— I think it’s our 15th year in business—I’ve really pulled myself out of the agency because my end goal is to sell the agency. I have a wife and two kids. I love what I’m doing right now, which is seeing things at a higher level and only cherry-picking the projects I want to work on, which really aren’t the whole web development or web design aspect. My forte, I’ll say, is more in the hosting and maintenance area. For some reason, I just gravitated toward that end of it because I love the challenge. We have a team that handles the support, but when I see support, I get CC’d on all the support tickets when I probably shouldn’t because they just inundate my inbox. I’ll pick the ones I want to work on because I actually enjoy working on those, and that’s what I do in the afternoons. I hope that answered your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And then some! Does everyone’s resume look as extensive as yours, or do you occasionally get someone who might have two resumes—two different people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Well, first let me just tell you about my staff. The majority of my staff, our leadership, is very experienced. I try to vet everyone who comes through the door, all of our staff, and I try to hire people who have many years of experience. Sometimes that can bite you because they’re not up on the new technology. And I&#8217;m up on the new technology. In fact, I’m up on it at 4:30 or 5 o’clock in the morning, just buying SaaS products that I’m wasting money on just to see what those SaaS products are like and how we can utilize them in the agency, only to find out a few months later that they’re not worth it. It’s like, &#8220;Teens years of experience.&#8221; You just mentioned one: a double resume. About two weeks ago, we hired a gentleman—I won’t say any names—who was really an experienced SEO. He wasn</p>\n\n\n\n<p>’t really in the whole e-commerce realm but was an experienced SEO. That’s a portion that we’re really trying to build out in our agency. We see good opportunities there, especially utilizing AI in that space. So anyway, we hired this guy. I vetted him, I hired him, and he started last week. Everything seemed to be going great. I was on vacation last week, so I didn’t really get any face-to-face time with him, but this week I did. I had face-to-face time with him yesterday, along with the rest of my marketing team. We had a group meeting, and his face wasn’t on the Google Meet, though it normally was when I was interviewing him and discussing the role. Anyway, I could tell something was not right; I could just tell. As we were in the meeting, I went into my G Suite, and I looked up his IP address and saw an IP address from the Philippines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that raised a red flag. I asked him to show his face, and he wouldn’t show his face. He said he had to restart his computer. So I said, “Well, you know what? Instead of showing your face, just tell me your birthday,” because I knew his birthday from a background check that we ran on him. He couldn’t say his birthday. He just dropped off. So immediately at that moment, I picked up my phone and called this guy, and he answered the phone while he was in the meeting with me. “Hey Joe, how’s it going?” So I knew something was up, and I would not stop, man. I just kept grinding, trying to get it out of him. It turns out he was working a couple of different jobs in the same role, but who knows if it was even him doing the work or not. I know one of his previous employers— it definitely wasn’t him doing the work because I phoned them, and now apparently he no longer has a job there either. So again, I’m not going to mention any names, but that was an interesting day yesterday and part of my morning today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, I’m glad that you shared that story because there are a lot of agency owners out there that hire remote workers. We have to. You need workers, and just like you said, you want people who are experienced and know their craft, and it may mean you have to hire them from somewhere else remotely. This could happen to anyone as an agency owner, so knowing to check…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Yeah, especially in the WooCommerce space. Companies, especially now, are remote. From 2010 to 2019, we were renting a place, and then we bought our own. When COVID came, we all went remote, as everyone did. But then when COVID went away, we all came back to work. Last December, I said, “You know what? The majority of our staff isn’t even in our area, and some of our staff here is kind of hybrid anyway, so let’s just rent out the Zen building, and everybody&#8217;s remote.” So we all went remote in January. I’m in the office today; I actually came here for the meeting because I have a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old, and they’re not back in school yet, obviously. I didn’t want to have them screaming in the background, so I came to the office. It’s pretty desolate here; it’s not rented out yet, and it’s pretty desolate. But you run into that— you have remote employees, and you really don’t know what you’re getting. You really do have to vet them. I thought I did vet this guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Especially in the WordPress space, so much is remote. I mean, Automattic being a remote-first company in general, you look at that. So obviously, folks associated with WooCommerce are more likely to be remote, and let’s even ignore the COVID office killer part of the equation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Well, and there were a lot of people during the pandemic that you heard about who did the very exact thing that guy did to you, where they were taking on multiple jobs. There was one person I know who had three full-time jobs. Three full-time jobs! And yeah, there’s no way you&#8217;re doing that. “Oh, well, it’s just balance.” I was like, “No, it’s not just balance. There’s no way you can truly work three full-time jobs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />No, I’m the only one who could do that for real. I’m doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Well, that’s true, that’s true. I guess if we count your fatherhood, you definitely have three full-time jobs going there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I remember seeing articles in all the papers about that, in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and they’re still talking about it—where folks are… There’s got to be a fun little word for it… Well, just multi-jobbing, double-dipping, triple-dipping…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />I’ll tell you, it’s got to be a lot easier now with ChatGPT and all the other AI tools out there. I mean, it just makes it super easy for them to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />So now Joe, do you and/or any of your staff attend the WordPress events out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />We did a local event; there was one a few years ago. Sean and I—Sean is our solution specialist—went to WooConf in Austin back in 2016, and that was an amazing time. WooCommerce stopped doing those for a bit, and that was the last one we went to. We also went to WordCamp Maryland, but we were only there for one day. We drove out and drove back that day. It’s kind of tough; you have to do a lot online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />So you were mentioning earlier when we were talking about some of the types of work that Zen does that you have a WooCommerce project that you have put in a case study to Woo about. Tell us about that project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />The case study is nearing completion, and we just reached out because all the Woo experts are in this… Can we still call ourselves Woo experts? I know we switched over to an Automattic thing just recently. We’re still the Woo experts. So we reached out, and we’re submitting this week—tomorrow, in fact. It’s a very interesting project that we worked on. Have you guys ever heard of Algolia? It’s a search and discovery platform. Oh yeah, the ability to build a site on WooCommerce is excellent for customizing. I mean, you can do anything with it, and you can’t do that with Shopify, not like you can with WooCommerce. So we built a jeweler’s site. This guy approached us at the end of last year. He had a ring builder, so basically you pick your setting, then you pick your stone, and then you go through a whole checkout process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We built out this site for him to create that with WooCommerce, and it essentially gives you the ability to have a site with a million products on it, and they all get indexed on the Algolia search and discovery platform so that when someone is searching or filtering for those products, it’s not just a second, but it is literally like microseconds. It’s instant. I mean, you can click and filter, and it’s completely instant. But it’s one where it walks you through a process of building a ring and then going into a checkout with the whole Algolia tab panel type of thing. So you’re going through the step process. We scoped it out; we built it out. But I didn’t realize how great of an idea this thing was, and there are competitors in the space doing this, but this thing increased revenues by hundreds of thousands instantly because people really wanted this—people who wanted to build their own engagement ring. So it was a really interesting project for us to work on. This case study should be finished by tomorrow and submitted so that other folks can see this project and what it took to actually build it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So Joe, is this a plugin available on the WordPress plugin directory?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Soon it will be. It’s not a plug-and-play type of plugin, and that’s the problem with it. I have probably $120,000 to $150,000 invested in this thing, and it’s not a plugin that we could actually just sell to you, and you just add it to your site because it’s more complicated than that. So there will be a free version—you’ll be able to download that plugin and use it—but all the goodies that come with it are premium, and that’s when you need the premium version of the plugin. But then you also need the development because there are customizations that could be done to it. Like I said, you can’t just simply buy that plugin. I wish that you could, but the support would be crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It sounds like it’s almost like an enterprise plugin, so you’d need enterprise-focused agencies to really take advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />You need enterprise. It’s not for a mom-and-pop shop. But also, a mom-and-pop shop’s not going to have a million products on their site. This is for a type of site that’s going to sell engine parts for all different vehicles because it’s based on year, make, and model, and those are nested. So you have year, make, model, engine size, and that’s all a whole nesting taxonomy that goes into your database. It could be quite a mess if you don’t do some custom work on the back end. That’s why it’s more for enterprise, which is good for us because then you kind of dig your hooks into a client. You need this for your</p>\n\n\n\n<p>enterprise website, and you need us now for your enterprise website as well, which is always a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />So Joe, does Zen Agency work with any other agencies out there? Do you find any cross-projects?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />That’s something that’s always been in the back of my mind, especially with the other WooCommerce experts. I’ve thought about that in the past in our Slack channel. As a matter of fact, a few of us have reached out to each other, but nothing has ever really come to fruition there. But I kind of wish it did because each of us has our own strengths. Like ours, we’re a full-service agency, but where’s our strength? It’s more in putting out fires. I hate to say that, but a lot of the work we get is fixing what another agency may have messed up or what a solo entrepreneur messed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />So what’s your future plan there, Joe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />My end goal really is to continue to build Zen for a few more years. That may be through M&amp;A. That’s definitely on the table. I’ve looked at other agencies; there hasn’t been something there that really whet my appetite enough to take that leap. I came really close a couple of times, but that still isn’t where I want it. We’ve been in this business for a long time, and I think some other agencies look at us and see that we’re really fine-tuned. But we’re not fine-tuned yet because it’s ever-changing. I’m trying to build an operating system—my agency’s operating system—so that when a sale comes in from a WooCommerce lead online form, then what happens? I actually had this conversation with our solution specialist and two of our other sales guys. I said, &#8220;Well, then what happens? The form gets answered, and if we get the response, then what happens? Or what if we don’t get a response? If we don’t get a response, they go over here, and that ends with the contract being signed. And if the contract is signed, then if it’s development or marketing—let’s say it’s development—then that part of the operating system flowchart kicks in, and then what happens? Then we have a client meeting, and there’s always stuff that happens in between.&#8221; So at the end of the day, we have this big giant flowchart of the processes of the agency, and I am still working on the operating system. It’s been two years, and it kills me because I know I can get there. I have my whole team working on their components of it, and it’s a lot more difficult being a WooCommerce agency doing this when you’re a full-service agency because a lot of the other WooCommerce agencies, and I think this is one of the things that separates us from a lot of the other WooCommerce or even development agencies, that’s not just what we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what I mean? We’re into hosting, maintenance, WooCommerce development, all forms of marketing. So there are a lot of moving parts that make it a lot more complicated to pull this off. But once I pull this off—the operating system—then I know I can get a high multiple on my agency and sell it because right now it’s not like I’m starving to sell the agency. I’m starving to build it. I really enjoy building it. So I’m probably about five years out. In five years, I’d like to sell it to someone who can just take it, turn the key, and run with it—someone who’s really passionate about it—because our whole team is passionate. We’re totally transparent, unlike that employee that I hired. So when I hand the keys over, I want to make sure they’re able to run it because I didn’t build this to where it is today after all these years for nothing, and I would not want to see it flop in anyone else’s hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Great. I think a lot of agency owners have the same mission as you— to figure out your templates and your processes so that it is something that is a sellable product. Because some agencies, as we know, become—especially when the owners work the agency as well and do the production—they’re so tied. They’re so tied to the person, not the agency, that the clients are. I’m saying that it’s hard to sell an agency. But doing it the way you’re doing it, where you are basically just building and overseeing this agency, you’re not getting yourself personally tied to those clients. And so I think that’s a very smart way of doing an agency if someone can afford to build their agency that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />Well, if I can give any bit of advice to anyone— a lot of WooCommerce agencies are joining the platform— my advice to them would be to hustle. I’ve had two jobs for many, many years, and my wife’s not here, but she would attest to this, and my whole staff would too. I’ve worked these two jobs, and there have been many times where I worked until one o&#8217;clock, two o&#8217;clock in the morning—straight through the night—never mind that, straight through the night to have to go to work the next day because you’re putting out a fire, right? A server’s down right before Black Friday. We had a complete mess many years ago with a very big client in the gift basket industry, and that could have sunk our ship if I didn’t really get all hands on deck on it. But to any of the newer agencies that are coming up, my advice would be to try to do it the way I did it because you do it debt-free, right? That’s another thing I pride myself on with this agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a cafe in Scranton, and I didn’t do my due diligence on it, and I took a loan out for it. The cafe went belly up because the university directly across the street—now, I was selling paninis and espressos and lattes, like Starbucks-type stuff—had I done my due diligence, I would’ve known that less than a year later they were breaking ground directly across the street to build a full food court in the University of Scranton with a Starbucks and everything else. They erected a fence that spanned two blocks, and it blocked all the students from coming over while they were doing this build-out. So I completely lost all of my customers overnight, and that went belly up. I was in a rough spot back then. That was about the mid-2000s, like 2005-ish. Learning from that, I would say try to build something like this without pulling outside capital. I don’t know if that works for everyone, but it worked for me because I built a company that has no debt. Not many companies can do that. Not many companies can say that they did that, and it makes it a lot easier to build because there’s a lot less stress in your life—not like, &#8220;How am I going to pay these bills?&#8221; Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah. I do think that web agencies are one of the types of companies that do… It’s easier to do. It’s not like a restaurant where you have to have a physical space. You have to have certain equipment. Yeah. I mean, you could have a laptop and get an agency up and off the ground. So I think it does mean you can do those without debt if you want to. You can start an agency. So we are getting close to our time here. Robert, did you have any other final questions or comments?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I’ve got so many. I want to really dive into this magical agency operating system you’re building. I think we’re going to have to save that for another time. I want to see how AI has blown that up or maybe optimized it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />So we’re just now getting into the AI agent space and really trying to utilize the agents to perform a lot of this work. Especially with agencies, like you guys said, hiring remotely that may not necessarily even be closely remote—they could be far remote. And so when there’s an actual language barrier and stuff, that makes it a lot more difficult to run your agency. But when you employ AI agents and it’s done effectively, it can really streamline your operation to the point where you have lead people running things and the agents being your busy workers doing the actual work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Very cool stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />That’s part of the operating system. But do invite me back sometime in the future; I’ll show you the operating system. In fact, I’ll even notify you once it’s complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />There we go. There we go. You’ll have a book out; you’ll be on a public speaking circuit, and then we’ll have you back on the show. Yeah. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Joe, for coming and visiting with us today. We loved learning about Zen Agency and your plans for the future. How can people reach you? Let’s let them know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />They can visit our site, Zen Agency, or they can call our number: (800) 775-9610.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Phone number. Magical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Right? I know. I think that’s the first time we’ve had someone give a phone number on here. Interesting. I like it. An 800 number to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe:<br />There you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Cool. All right, well, that’s all we’ve got for today, so thanks for listening to this episode of Do the Woo Agency Chat, and catch the next episode coming up.

This change aims to attract more newcomers to WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/_dorsvenabili/\">Rocio Valdivia</a> explained, “The Community Team’s goal for upcoming events is to warmly welcome more first-time attendees. <strong>We aim for</strong> <strong>over 50% of participants to be newcomers</strong> <strong>while celebrating returning attendees</strong>. To achieve this, event organizers should focus on attracting new participants through well-planned event design, messaging, and marketing strategies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new proposal reads: “A portion of the WordCamp budget may be allocated for marketing and advertising, subject to the approval of a Program Manager during your budget review and funded by the Global Sponsorship grant.” The amount can range from $50 to $400 based on factors like the organizers&#8217; experience, cost of living, and the size of the local community, and it should be utilized to maximize the event’s reach and impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically WordCamps have only very rarely included advertising expenses in their budgets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocio has also shared some suggestions and advised that “Advertising funds should be used strategically to attract new attendees and raise awareness.” Her suggested strategies include listing events on online calendars, tech forums, newsletters and publications, collaborating with influencers and local businesses, distributing posters, flyers, and banners in strategic locations, running social media Ads and using traditional media to promote the events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proposal assumes importance in light of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/05/31/current-challenges-of-wordpress-events-shaping-the-future/\">latest stats</a> showing that the number of new attendees has declined despite the number of events increasing during the Community Team’s re-engagement project. Automattic-sponsored Community Engagement Specialist <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/07/04/first-time-attendees/\">Julia Golomb said</a>, “This decline underscores the importance of intentionally attracting and welcoming first-time attendees. They bring fresh perspectives, new energy, and potential for long-term growth of the WordPress community and user base.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal has sparked several responses and suggestions from the WordPress community. Taco Verdonschot, community manager at Yoast, has suggested creating a subteam of PPC experts in the marketing/PR team to run campaigns and also drew attention to the SEO issues of websites on wordcamp.org. “If we’re ready to spend money on advertising, maybe we can also spend some money/resources on optimizing our sites and site structure for online marketing.”, he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost de Valk, founder of the Yoast SEO plugin, also echoed Taco’s sentiments:&nbsp; “I don’t need money. Just need permission to install an SEO plugin on those sites.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested community members can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/08/07/proposed-change-to-advertising-marketing-expense-guidelines/\">share their feedback</a> on the proposal before August 19, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proposal comes after the Community Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/07/23/venue-policy-update/\">updated the WordPress Events venue policy</a> last month to permit the use of venues with religious affiliations. The new policy advises avoiding venues that maintain political affiliations, feature religious iconography, host religious worship, or engage in any form of proselytizing to organizers or attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incidentally, <a href=\"https://netherlands.wordcamp.org/2024/wordcamp-netherlands-rescheduled/\">WordCamp Netherlands was rescheduled</a> from September to November 2024 due to low ticket sales. Hopefully, these changes will boost the success of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>I&#8217;ve survived the Hunger Games <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f973.png\" alt=\"🥳\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, making a success of your WordPress product in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Katie Keith and Matt Cromwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie is the founder and CEO at Barn2 plugins, and Matt is co-founder of GiveWP and Senior Director of Customer Experience at StellarWP. They have been running the WP Product Talk podcast together since early 2023, where they interview WordPress product owners to get the inside scoop on running a successful business in the WordPress ecosystem. And they&#8217;ve collated much of what they&#8217;ve learned on the show to create the ultimate blueprint on how to build a successful WordPress product, which they reveal during their WordCamp Europe presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the world of WordPress product development and marketing. This touches upon topics such as enhancing the WordPress admin interface with additional features that feel like a natural extension, and finding success through organic content and a consistent user focused YouTube strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore important marketing strategies within the WordPress community, emphasizing the value of identifying gaps in the market and leveraging event attendance for growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie gives her thoughts on the power of explainer videos focused on solving user problems, and how Google and YouTube work hand in hand to surface relevant content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt discusses the challenges of pricing products correctly, setting expectations, and offering strategic discounts without de-valuing their worth, focusing on the importance of listening to customer feedback to prioritize future product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They both provide practical advice on creating a user-friendly product that feels like a part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of our talk, Katie and Matt get into the value of transparency and the human touch in business. The significance of an up-to-date about us page and their approach to face-to-face customer interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress product developer, or just interested in the intricate world of WordPress business, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Katie Keith and Matt Cromwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Katie Keith and Matt Cromwell. How are you both doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Doing really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Good thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re in Turin, we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe 2024. We&#8217;re up in the media room, and we&#8217;re going to talk today about the presentation that these fine people did yesterday. But before we get into that, do you just want to introduce yourself? Let&#8217;s take Katie first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> I&#8217;m Katie Keith, co-founder and CEO at Barn2 Plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> And I&#8217;m Matt Cromwell, co-founder of GiveWP and Senior Director of Customer Experience at StellarWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so tell us about your presentation. Normally when I do these conversations, I have a script. I write down the questions because I know what the person has been talking about, but yours, I didn&#8217;t know, so it&#8217;s going to be very much a conversation. First of all, just tell us what the title was and what it was about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:24] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> We interviewed 50 plus WordPress product owners, and this is what we learned. And the whole idea was that, we&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of product owners, and there&#8217;s actually a lot of things they say that are very similar in terms of best practices and how to do things. And we talked about this in the presentation, that we wanted to democratise business insights for everyone. Rather than just only talking about it in hallway tracks, we wanted to be able to have a lot more people hear it and join the conversation, and that&#8217;s what the whole purpose of WP Product Talk is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So what is WP Product Talk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> WP Product Talk is a weekly podcast, occasionally weekly podcast. We&#8217;re on a break right now. Where we bring on a guest to speak about their expertise, or something they&#8217;re really passionate about, in terms of building a product business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we have co-hosts. We always tell them it&#8217;s a conversation, not an interview. So we have our own insights and experiences that we bring to the fore as well. We have four co-hosts, myself, Katie and Amber Hinds from Equalize Digital, and Zach Katz from Gravity Kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But they&#8217;re all product owners. Everybody that comes on your show is a product owner, and you just get into a conversation, see where that leads you. And you&#8217;ve gained some insights over the last, what, 50 did you say, episodes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Now it&#8217;s like 65 episodes, but they&#8217;re almost always product owners. Occasionally they are an expert in a specific field, where we ask them to come and talk about their expertise because it&#8217;s hyper relevant to product owners. So everything we talk about is directed at product owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;ve assembled some of the top tips, some of the advice that you got from these product owners. And you went and stood on stage, and apparently there were some technical gremlins, which can&#8217;t be particularly nice, but that&#8217;s what you did. You stood on stage and distilled your learnings over the last 65 episodes, so we&#8217;re going to get into that. What did you talk about on stage?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:14] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> So we went through all of the previous episodes and picked out the best advice from all of them, which we divided into four categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four categories were product development, marketing, customer experience, and business. And in each of those, we chose about three previous guests who have been on the podcast to talk about those topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thought we&#8217;d take a new format, which was Matt&#8217;s idea for the talk, which we haven&#8217;t seen at previous WordCamps, which is where, instead of just hearing from Matt and myself as the speakers, we included audio from the previous podcast episodes. So each section had an audio from somebody like people from Ellipsis who specialise in marketing, or people from particular product companies, and so on. So you got to hear from all of these experts, as well as Matt and myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How did it go down? Was it well received, well attended?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> We were really happy. It was actually a totally packed house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:14] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> We were on track three, which we wish we would&#8217;ve been informed that it wasn&#8217;t going to be live streamed. We would&#8217;ve live streamed it from WP Product Talk if we knew that. The people seemed to be really receptive. We got a lot of positive feedback. There were definitely some technical hiccups, but we were able to grace our way through it more or less. I just make fun of myself the whole time, and people feel better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The technical hiccups weren&#8217;t that the audio didn&#8217;t play, was it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> The audio was just challenging. There was this whole issue of, it didn&#8217;t auto play the audio like it was supposed to. They had to click on it manually. It was a mess. We had to telepathically communicate with IT about what was going on, and it took about five slides ish until we had a good rhythm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, okay, you&#8217;ve distilled it all down, you&#8217;ve talked to different people, you&#8217;ve put them on slides, and you&#8217;ve shown these people&#8217;s wisdom to the audience. Let&#8217;s hear it. What kernels of wisdom did you draw, and what were the bits that made it into the presentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well, the first section was about product development, and we focused a lot on how to design an intuitive product, ideally inspired by WordPress itself. Because if you use a lot of themes or plugins, you&#8217;ll see some integrate beautifully with WordPress, and others really look stuck on, and have reinvented the wheel, so it feels like it&#8217;s not WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve advised people to make it feel like it&#8217;s part of WordPress, and particularly like the block editor, so that when somebody lands on your product for the first time, it already feels familiar to them. And ideally they can get up and running without even having to read the documentation or anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We included a screenshot from GiveWP in that section, where their create a donation form looks like the block editor, so that people can just get started with it, without even having to learn or read the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the idea being that if you are, I guess, if you&#8217;re new to WordPress, you can just drop right into whatever that experience is, where you just, I don&#8217;t know, installed a plugin, or something like that. And you&#8217;re not trying to learn, okay, here&#8217;s a new color palette. I don&#8217;t know what that button does. I don&#8217;t know where this goes. Why is it in a different font? Just keep it WordPress, keep it simple, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:18] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Exactly, yeah. That way people will be much more successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also gave other pieces of advice, such as maybe adding some kind of a onboarding or setup wizard to take people through the key features of the product when they first install it, to make it even easier for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting because some of the biggest plugins out there don&#8217;t follow that advice, do they? I mean, I&#8217;m sure that you can name a dozen or more plugins where you install it and you are hijacked. So I guess for some people it works. For other people, it doesn&#8217;t. But the advice, if you&#8217;re starting out, at least the advice that you&#8217;ve just given is, go with WordPress, keep it simple, don&#8217;t overcomplicate. You don&#8217;t need to waste your time and effort making a unique UI that doesn&#8217;t need to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:59] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I think one way we said it was to enhance, not replace the admin. There&#8217;s definitely ways in which you can do additional things in your settings page, or in any configuration, or in Gutenberg itself that isn&#8217;t exactly what WordPress is all the time, but it should look like a natural extension of it. So enhance, don&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we gave a couple pretty good examples. Kadence does a good job as well. When you&#8217;re in the customizer, they actually have this custom footer area that helps you to customise your footer, ideally. And it looks and feels a lot like an extension of the customizer, even though it&#8217;s not native to the customizer at at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so mimicking the WordPress UI as well. Okay, that&#8217;s interesting. Okay, so that&#8217;s a good piece of advice. Where do we go next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:41] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> The next category after that was marketing. And in marketing in particular, we covered several different kind of subtopics. We talked about community a bit, we talked about how you optimise which channel you might use. Alex Denning was in there, Kathy Zant was in there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think some of the biggest things that we talked about were just being able to identify where you&#8217;re winning in marketing, and to double down on that, and to also take your community around your product really seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do either of you have products outside of WordPress? No, shaking head, no. Okay, so given that you&#8217;ve both got products inside a WordPress, how hard is it to market to the WordPress crowd? I get this intuition that the people that use WordPress, and especially people that attend events like this, have a different approach. Their relationship to being marketed toward is very different. I feel that we don&#8217;t like being marketed at as a community. Do you think my intuitions are wrong there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:38] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yes and no. Me personally, I have observed that, when I go to WordCamps, people have that sentiment. They&#8217;re often highly opinionated about what plugins should or shouldn&#8217;t do in the admin. And most often that&#8217;s because they are building websites for their clients, and they don&#8217;t want to hand over a website to the client that looks like a bunch of spam in the admin area. So I understand where they&#8217;re coming from, but I don&#8217;t believe that the WordPress community represents the 90% of customers out there that are purchasing our products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I also feel that, if we were to rewind the clock, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say 10 years or something like that, I feel launching a product in the WordPress space would&#8217;ve been a lot more straightforward. You know, what have we got now? 60,000 plus plugins in the repository. Countless, I have no idea how many commercial plugins there are out there. There&#8217;s probably 10 or 15 different form solutions. If you want to create custom post types, there&#8217;s bunches of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think it is harder now to market into the community? You&#8217;ve both got products with a history, you&#8217;ve kind of crossed that bridge already. So you&#8217;ve struggled through that and come through the other side. But if you&#8217;re just beginning your journey with a product in the WordPress space, I&#8217;m imagining it&#8217;s harder now than it ever has been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:48] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, when I first started selling products, we found ideas which didn&#8217;t already exist. I could just write one blog post about this topic and it would go straight to the top of Google, because nobody else had ever written about that, there were no products doing that. And as the ecosystem has grown, that has obviously become more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I believe there are still gaps in the market where you can do that. You just have to be really, really in there with WordPress, WooCommerce, whatever you&#8217;re specialising in, in order to find those gaps. So I&#8217;m still aware of gaps in WooCommerce in particular, where you could launch a product and nobody else has ever written about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example of a new product I released only a couple of years ago was WooCommerce discontinued products. Nobody had ever written about that because there was no products that allowed you to discontinue your products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So things like that, they&#8217;re often quite small ideas, but if you&#8217;re just starting out then, if you&#8217;re not like a funded startup, and you&#8217;re bootstrapping, then maybe you want a fairly small plugin, which you can hopefully start getting sales, get some experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d say keep your eyes open, and try to find something that is unique and it is still possible, although I accept it&#8217;s not as easy as it used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What do you use as your primary marketing channels, plural? What is there out there? You know, you could use Google ads, you could use Facebook ads, you could use an email list, you could go on podcasts, or start your own podcast. What are you doing that you found has worked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:17] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> The best marketing channel for me has always been organic content on our own website. So that&#8217;s generally quite specific things that people are searching for, about how to achieve certain goals using our plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our second main marketing channel is YouTube, which we also covered in the marketing section of our presentation yesterday. Because YouTube&#8217;s actually the second largest search engine in the world. We did a quote from Jamie Marsland, who&#8217;s a big YouTube influencer, as well as a WordPress product owner at the moment. In which he said, you need to have a consistent YouTube strategy and stick to it. And I think that&#8217;s really important, because you can&#8217;t just stick the odd video on YouTube and expect to get sales from it. Because YouTube is all about building a following. And also learning how to do it in a way that appeals to people psychologically, with things like effective thumbnails, and titles that make people click. So if you&#8217;re going to do YouTube, do it properly as Jamie suggested, but the rewards can be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What do you do? Like explainer videos about the product, or just more general WordPressy content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:24] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Most of our YouTube content is explainer tutorials about our products, although we are always experimenting with how to build our following more widely. So we do have some videos, for example, we don&#8217;t have any translation plugins at Barn2, but we did a best translations plugin YouTube video recently, which is currently one of our top 10 videos in terms of views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do the explainer videos actually cause conversions? Because you&#8217;d imagine that if you were looking at an explainer video, you&#8217;ve already bought the product, and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out how something works. But I guess maybe not, maybe you are just exploring, and just seeing what the product can do with the intention of buying it. So if you did go down that road, and just do explainer content, that could still be effective as a marketing tool, which is kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:07] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> The best way to do explainer content on YouTube is to put the user&#8217;s problem first, not the product. So, say we have a WooCommerce product table plugin, but the tutorial shouldn&#8217;t be called How to Use the WooCommerce Product Table Plugin. It should be about how to create a searchable one page order form in WooCommerce or something. So if somebody&#8217;s looking, they&#8217;re searching for something about creating a product order form, then they will find this and our product is the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting, my use of YouTube always seems to give me the same content. If I watch, I don&#8217;t know, I watch a lot of music videos, so I get lots of music videos. So I would have to use the Google search engine in order to find a YouTube video. But I guess, if you are, I don&#8217;t know, constantly searching for WordPress content, it may surface your YouTube marketing videos as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:01] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I mean, Google definitely operates that way. It&#8217;s definitely watching you wherever it possibly can, and it will elevate the relevant content. The reason YouTube is the second biggest search engine is specifically because of the way in which it compliments and mimics the Google search engine itself. Even if you&#8217;re searching on Facebook sometimes for something, you&#8217;ll end up finding interesting new recommendations in your YouTube feed because of your traffic in Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What do you think about the state of building a product in the WordPress space now? As I said a minute ago, if you rewind the clock 10 years, I feel it was much more of a build it and they will come kind of thing, because you were quite likely the first person to come up with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know now that that&#8217;s no longer the case. Marketing, it can&#8217;t be a sort of afterthought. If you&#8217;re going to be building a product, if you&#8217;re a developer, you have to have that as a plan from the outset. So it&#8217;s not build it, then think about marketing. It&#8217;s more, build it at the same time as trying to figure out the marketing, because it probably won&#8217;t succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you might get lucky, right? I mean, there&#8217;s always that, but typically I would imagine now, because we&#8217;ve got this fairly saturated marketplace, you&#8217;ve got to put marketing front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:10] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I have mixed responses to that sentiment from my personal experiences. One is that, being the old man in the room, I&#8217;m like, it wasn&#8217;t easy back in my day kids. Yes, I get it, I get the whole idea that it was easier back then. And sure, for sure, but we would not have had success without really strong marketing. We would not have had success without constantly iterating on the product all the time. And none of those things have changed. All of that is still ground zero for how to be a product owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the saturated market is a big aspect for sure. But we are seeing, of course, new opportunities like, at the moment, no one has really nailed exactly how we want to leverage AI and WordPress particularly well. And so there&#8217;s lots of opportunity there. It&#8217;s a little bit of a gold rush. You&#8217;re seeing a whole bunch of products being shipped to .org that all are AI related. Are any of them any good? They&#8217;re fine, I guess. Are any of them knocking it out of the park? Not necessarily, so far. Somebody is yet to really solve that new problem, or offer that new feature in a way that is really compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can tell you that, from my observations of .org all the time, people are shipping AI products all the time right now. And so the one who really nails it correctly, and markets it correctly is the one that&#8217;s going to start rising up to the top. So just as much as there&#8217;s a saturation of market, there&#8217;s also these new opening types of features that are coming along the way as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, truthfully, even when we shipped GiveWP, everyone said, I would never do a CRM in WordPress, it&#8217;s just not made for a CRM. Which I thought at the time was craziness, but it was a very developery conversation. There&#8217;s several very popular CRMs in WordPress now that are doing really well. Groundhogg is great. Fluent CRM is doing well. These are new emerging markets. So as much as I understand the sentiment, you have to have a little bit closer look at the market to recognise that there&#8217;s emerging markets, and there&#8217;s also new ways to do things, and there&#8217;s always a combination of having really excellent marketing along the side as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You can answer this question in a whole multitude of ways, but I&#8217;ll just put it out there and you can tell me what you think. Do you see events like this, the attendance of events like this, is that a useful marketing thing? I mean, obviously you can pay, have a sponsor booth, you&#8217;ve kind of nailed your flag to the mast a bit there. You know, you&#8217;re obviously here to sponsor. You said you, Katie I&#8217;m looking at at the moment, Katie said she&#8217;s not got a sponsor booth this time. But, is it a useful thing to attend WordPress meetups, WordCamps? Is that a useful part of the marketing jigsaw puzzle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:46] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I&#8217;ll answer first and just say that, GiveWP was built on the backs of meetups and WordCamps. It was fundamental to our growth. How do we measure that ROI? I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s lots of different ways over the years that I tried to, you know, I don&#8217;t like the salesy approach to it, but I can say that, because we were present at WordCamps, and people met us, there were times when six or seven months later after a WordCamp, I would have somebody personally email me and say, hey, I just bought GiveWP yesterday, and I met you at a WordCamp. That&#8217;s anecdotal for the most part, it&#8217;s not like huge data, but I really do assume that it was part of our continual growth, is how we invested in WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things have changed a bit. I mean, COVID changed everything for sure, and events are a bit different nowadays. And, is our target audience attending Workcamp EU? Less so. There are definitely agencies here, and agencies have a huge influence over what products their clients choose for their websites. So that&#8217;s always useful for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But generally speaking, the ROI that Stellar thinks of when we come to events like this, is how we are going to meet new partners, how we&#8217;re going to talk to up and coming developers who we might want to hire, how we can learn more from other companies who are doing similar things to us. It&#8217;s more of an industry event for us more. But the more local, boots on the ground, WordCamps are, I feel have really good ROI for products in particular, because they are a lot more affordable, and they&#8217;re a lot more localised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I hear the same story all the time, that measuring of the ROI from an event like this is nigh on impossible, but there&#8217;s something there. I mean, if there wasn&#8217;t, you wouldn&#8217;t have as many people attending on behalf of their companies, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Absolutely. I had a really great conversation with Omnisend. I won&#8217;t say anything that I believe they wouldn&#8217;t want me to say, but they have been investing in Shopify a lot, and they&#8217;re now also investing in WordPress right now. And they just told me a little bit about the differences between how they approach those two communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said that Shopify is very much sale oriented, and ROI driven, and revenue driven, and numbers driven, and the WordPress community is more of a community, and you have to come in open-minded, and open-handed, and make relationships. They saw that as a real clear, stark difference between the two. But it was clear also that, from what they were telling me, they see it as a valuable investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What was the next thing on the list that you said in your presentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:11] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> The third of the four categories we covered was customer experience, and particularly listening to your customers in a way that would directly allow you to make improvements to your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we started that section by talking about the experience of customers before they even buy your product. We focused on InstaWP because, since that was launched, a lot of WordPress product owners have been creating admin demos, where people can test drive the plugin in a pre-setup test site, which expires after a few hours or days, so they can see if they like it before they buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we included a quote from Vikas, the founder of InstaWP, with some tips about how to make the most of that. And we followed that up with our own tips, which included things like planning the demo from the user&#8217;s perspective, thinking what page should the InstaWP demo open on, because it could be a page in the front end, or the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I&#8217;ve been doing those projects myself at Barn2 with our own plugins, it&#8217;s actually quite interesting thinking, what is the most intuitive page to land somebody on, if they&#8217;re put on this site for the first time, where you&#8217;ve already set up your product? And generally that&#8217;s a backend page, but it does require a bit of thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we also showed a screenshot of some admin tours in our plugin demos, and The Events Calendar have a nice banner, which explains what to do and sources of support, and so on. So it&#8217;s all about thinking about the user&#8217;s experience, when they use your product in this demo environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final thing we did on that was to give some tips about actually how to close the sale, because if somebody likes the product that they&#8217;re test driving, obviously you want to make it really easy for them to purchase it. So we showed a screenshot of one of our Barn2 demos, which has a banner across the top, which has a link to the support page on our website in case someone&#8217;s a bit stuck, and also a link to buy the plugin if they like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in addition to that, we add everybody to Mailchimp so that they get a particular sequence of emails for that demo, which initially tells them how to use it and get set up. When the demo expires, it emails them again saying, now buy the plugin, with the obvious links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if they don&#8217;t buy it, we continue to send emails, giving them reasons to buy it. For example, that might include screenshots and case studies of other websites already using the plugin. So you get a kind of FOMO, fear of missing out effect that other people are successfully using this product, so you should be too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. Anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:44] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> The customer experience one is one of my favorite ones. We talked a lot also about face-to-face interactions, establishing relationship with our users as much as possible. And the extreme ROI that that brings in terms of valuable product insight, and even competitor insight, why people leave, why people stay, why people refund. All of those things show up when you have a stronger relationship with your customers, and investing in that time in a serious way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that one we quoted Amanda Gorman from StellarWP, and she really said, no matter what the size of business, investing in relationships in your customers is always a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also quoted Miriam Schwab about how she receives a lot of insight and feedback from her customers through support in particular. I really love the way she said, I like to get away from the feeling, like the feeling that I get 10 tickets a day about this subject, or the feeling that everybody&#8217;s asking about this new feature, and instead really having to go through data, and tagging things correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like the way in which she said that tags shouldn&#8217;t just be about like feature request, feature request, whatever, here&#8217;s a bug or whatnot. She said, you can also say, this is a usability issue. And she highlighted how somebody says, I just can&#8217;t figure out where to back up my site, for example. It&#8217;s not that the feature doesn&#8217;t exist, it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s broken, it&#8217;s just that they can&#8217;t figure out where that&#8217;s at. And that&#8217;s a usability issue. I thought that was a really unique approach to tagging feedback, in a way that would be really actionable for the product team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you both, in your own businesses, how do you decide what to build next? I mean, presumably there must be some intuition on your own part. You must be thinking, okay, this would be a nice feature to add in. But then also, there must be channels, whether it&#8217;s people writing you an email, or support requests, you know, we&#8217;ve got 50 support requests about this exact thing, we must build that. Where do you get your intuitions about what comes next, and is it often driven by, I mean, do you listen to your customers in that sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:36] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I personally am extremely biased. I really believe that products are always best when they are customer centric. If you&#8217;re not listening to your customers, you&#8217;re missing out on future sales, like bar none, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what was fascinating, as I was putting together all the audio clips for the whole presentation, there were a lot of presentations, regardless of the topic, where they specifically mentioned, you can&#8217;t really do development without listening to your customer, or you can&#8217;t do marketing without listening to your customer, or you can&#8217;t do good business without listening to your customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came up over and over again in a lot of different contexts. We have a system internally at Stellar, we use a couple different feedback boards, one is Canny, another one is featureOS, and we are logging customer feedback every single day, all the time. It&#8217;s a responsibility of the support team, or responsibility of the customer success team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the customers have the ability to vote up certain features and whatnot. And we track what has the most votes, and that is not necessarily to say that the thing that has the most votes is the most urgent feature, but it is something that has a high priority because of the volume of customer feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Katie, anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:44] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> At Barn2 we use a formula to help us decide what new features to develop, and that&#8217;s based on the amount of demand, like Matt mentioned. And in addition, it has a factor based on the impact that we think it would have on sales, and also the difficulty to implement it. And we have a formula which brings together the score in those three categories to create an overall score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then we kind of sort in descending order, when we are looking at new features to add, and use that to guide us. Of course, some feature requests aren&#8217;t relevant to the scope of the product, so you have to know what the purpose of your product is, and be firm on that sometimes and think. Maybe sometimes customers are asking for a particular feature that doesn&#8217;t fit within the scope, but they can achieve it by using a plugin from another company with your plugin, for example. So in that case, we might do some collaboration with that company to cross promote our products or something like that, instead of adding it as a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Most WordPress companies, I think, are following a subscription model now where, you know, you pay one year, and then you pay the next year, and there may be a discount or something like that. But I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s harder to get the customer on board than it is to retain them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of the effort will go into getting them that first time, and then hopefully, you know, with the discount, or just loyalty, or good support, or whatever it may be, you can keep them, I don&#8217;t know, 3, 4, 5, 6 years, whatever that may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, that was actually our last topic, which we kind of put under the category of business, experimentation with pricing models in particular. Mark Westguard talked about it specifically, that picking the right pricing model for your product is a really important idea. In WordPress, people do tend to go with annual renewals, but there have been others who have tried different things in different ways. There are even monthly payments that some folks have done. There are lifetime subscriptions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I will say, I&#8217;ve gone on a bit of a journey on that conversation, in the sense that I was always extremely anti that lifetime is never useful or beneficial. But there have been some folks who have said that, under certain circumstances, it makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we all know that a customer has a certain lifetime, and a lifetime value. If you can get that entire lifetime value upfront, it actually is an interesting model overall. But I still would say, if that&#8217;s the case, I would love to give them a five year license upfront instead of a lifetime one, because I&#8217;m always thinking of the cost of support over a course of a lifetime, which is a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Never is a lifetime, you know, five years or something like that seems to be about the right idea. But then you&#8217;ve got things like Black Friday to throw into the mix with the pricing. And it always seems to me that, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same for you, but do you tend to empty your wallet at Black Friday, and buy all the things at Black Friday? And then I think there&#8217;s quite a bit of waiting until next year comes around, and buy the exact same product again on the Black Friday deal time. Do you have any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:38] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> People definitely know when to look out for deals, and sales and whatnot. If anybody&#8217;s paying attention to Stellar, you know that July is a really important month at StellarWP. But other than that, business in general doesn&#8217;t work that way. You don&#8217;t only launch things in November, or you don&#8217;t only launch things in July. So the large majority of sales that come into any common business happens outside of those gigantic big sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, sometimes extreme discounting can also bring in a bunch of extreme customer problems, new customer problems. Folks who really only want to buy when you&#8217;re selling it at the bottom barrel price. They also tend to sometimes be the type of customer you don&#8217;t actually want to deal with a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is a balance you have to look for to be able to price your products correctly, and to discount them correctly, and set expectations correctly so that you&#8217;re still showing the value of what people are getting, and not devaluing your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the episode with Mark, everyone should listen to that episode, it was a really good episode actually, he talks a bit about that as well, so did James from Ellipsis. He talked quite a bit about pricing as well, which was a really good one that we didn&#8217;t get to get to in the presentation because of technical difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you discount upon renewal? There&#8217;s quite a few plugins that I, every year I buy it again, and again. And there is something about that, I don&#8217;t know, 30, 40%, which kind of draws me in. I have everything set in a calendar so I know when things are going to renew, and I always go in and see what the offer is going to be, and that sometimes swings me from, I&#8217;m going to discontinue using that right into, okay, I&#8217;ll pay it. Do you do any of that, either of you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:13] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> We don&#8217;t discount at renewal, but we will do strategic renewal discounts. So, we&#8217;ll send out early renewal emails if we can get folks to renew their subscription earlier at a discounted rate, that actually can be pretty beneficial to their lifetime value, or to their ability to continue to renew over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also will try to time early renewal discounts around when we know we&#8217;re having a sale, because we do have that issue where, you&#8217;re putting your product on extreme sale, and customers who are like, I&#8217;ve been spending money with you for three years and you&#8217;re not giving me a discount, well, we&#8217;ll give them a discount as a early renewal one, in order to prevent that type of feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that also helps prevent those who are try to be really savvy and get around the system by canceling their subscription early, or asking for a refund early and then buying again at the new, because that&#8217;s not a great customer experience for them because they&#8217;re getting a new license key, they got to go swipe out their license keys everywhere. We don&#8217;t want people to have to do that. So trying to get them a new, nice, easy path is the way we try to go. We do that by email segmentation for the most part, but if folks reach out early as well over email, we&#8217;ll reach out to them and help them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are some companies, not just in the WordPress space, but out there, who constantly seem to be having a sale, and the whole product always seems to be at 30% off. And I always have the intuition, what&#8217;s the real price? What is the actual real price? And that&#8217;s kind of an interesting thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I just want to ask, do you feel that WordPress is a more expensive place to be than it used to be, say 10 years ago? It feels like we have an ecosystem where, I don&#8217;t know, maybe things floated around the $47 for one year mark, where now it might be more like $197 or $397. I think it&#8217;s a more expensive place to be. I think everybody who&#8217;s got a business in the WordPress space would feel that&#8217;s justified. But, have you got any thoughts on that? Has it become more expensive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:05] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, I agree that, generally, it has become more expensive because 10 years ago there was, the predominant business model was set by companies like Envato with Theme Forest, and Code Canyon, and so on. In which they had a very low price for lifetime update. And for a while it was even lifetime support, although they changed that a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that created a expectation more widely throughout the industry, that plugins would just have a low lifetime value. And that has given lifetime pricing a bad name. Like Matt mentioned a minute ago, there can be a good business reason to do lifetime, but people are often really absolutely against that because they remember those days. And I think a lot of people that will have bought products on one of the Envato marketplaces like Theme Forest, will have seen a theme be discontinued, and they&#8217;re stuck with it. And it breaks the whole website after a WordPress update or something, and they have to either change themes, or hire a developer to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really big problem because those were not sustainable business models, and these theme authors, and plugin authors couldn&#8217;t afford to be providing lifetime support for that tiny one off cost. So that&#8217;s why they discontinued those products. And so that&#8217;s very different to the companies that offer Lifetime now for maybe four times the annual cost. So yeah, it&#8217;s got more expensive, but you can trust the companies you&#8217;re buying from more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:29] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I&#8217;d also say that, running a business that develops products for WordPress has gotten more expensive over the years as well, because WordPress itself has actually evolved in ways that, developmentally, it&#8217;s more challenging to develop with WordPress than it was before. Requires a lot more different types of code knowledge than it ever did before. And the industry in general, around really good, experienced PHP developers, MySQL developers, Javascript developers, React developers, of which you need your WordPress developer to be all of those things, has just really become more and more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the fact that, as a whole, which I&#8217;m really happy about this, even though it sounds like a big problem. In support, when people reach out for a support, a technical support issue, they really are hoping and expecting that you can help them regardless of whether your plugin had to do anything with the problem or not. And I think that&#8217;s actually a good thing, but that means that all your support technicians have to be highly technical, highly capable. You really can&#8217;t get away with like a tier one, entry level triage type of support as well anymore. It really demands a bit more expertise than previously. And those things cost money, and it&#8217;s not sustainable to continue to basically run product on the cheap, and then expect really high end results either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Whenever I come across a brand new product in the WordPress space that I&#8217;ve never heard of before, which is usually several times a week actually, it really is huge the amount of new things out there. I have this journey and my mouse goes, you know, I&#8217;ve landed on the homepage, I then end up on the pricing page almost immediately, I&#8217;ve just quick scroll through the homepage. And then the one that I&#8217;m really interested in is the About Us page. That&#8217;s where I spend most of my time. Because, given the capacity to, I don&#8217;t know, poorly code something, you&#8217;re going to spend some money, it&#8217;s going to go into your website, then there may be a refund or what have you, but there&#8217;s a lot of trust going on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where I want to know who you are. I want to know what your heritage is, what other things that you&#8217;ve got. So if I had had a product, and you had asked me on your podcast, that would&#8217;ve been my one, is get your About Us page straightened out, and make sure that the human side of you comes out. You&#8217;re not just this great big entity. I think the WordPress space is drawn towards individuals, it&#8217;s kind of probably why we turn up to events like this. So anyway, that&#8217;s my little piece of wisdom at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:52] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> It&#8217;s a really good point. I have a small little blog series I do personally called Shiny New Plugins, where I audit the newest free plugins on .org, and I just highlight ones that look really interesting to me. And I will say that I try to figure out who&#8217;s behind the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently there was one that was launched named PersonalizeWP, and I was like, this looks really interesting. And I checked it out, and it was backed by an agency, and Paul Halfpenny is one of the authors there, and I met him and I was like, this looks really legit. So just the fact that his agency was behind it, and that they&#8217;re really putting time and energy into it, it spoke a lot for the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also saw one called UiChemy, which is kind of a weird name, but they&#8217;re sponsors are here at WordCamp EU right now. They did a whole Figma to WordPress export plugin, which is really interesting. But the personal touch, the fact that there&#8217;s actual people, and an actual company behind a product makes a big difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So the short circuit for that is that you&#8217;ve already been in business for 10 years. That is an immediate win for me because I can see that, oh, you&#8217;ve stuck around, you&#8217;ve got 10 years under your belt. But obviously most companies that are starting haven&#8217;t been around for 10 years, but there are still ways of doing it. Make yourself human, turn up to events, portray yourself in a positive way. And there&#8217;s definitely times when I&#8217;ve been to plugin sites, and the About Us page has been the thing which has made me close the browser and move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:11] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, the about page is more important than it used to be as well for other reasons, because Google&#8217;s doing a lot of updates at the moment, which add the credibility of the site as a big factor for rankings. And that involves, Google needs to know who&#8217;s behind the site as well, and that it&#8217;s credible, and that you are linking to other places linked from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe if you&#8217;ve got your team on there, then it would be good to have links to your socials, so that they can see that you are real people with a significant following. So whatever you&#8217;ve got that could add credibility, it&#8217;s worth having that on your about page, and also elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for this reason, at Barn2, we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work on that. They call it EEAT, and I&#8217;ve forgotten what that stands for, but it&#8217;s to do with the trust factors on your website. So we are redesigning our about page to add a lot more of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like Trustpilot reviews, and testimonials from customers, and also links to media coverage that we&#8217;ve had, so that Google and real people can see that the people running the company are active in the wider media. And even things like this podcast here, for example, might go on our about page, so that people can see our work within the community. And that will impress both search engines and real users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting, because if I&#8217;m buying clothes, or paperclips, or dog food, or whatever it might be, I couldn&#8217;t care less who makes it. Honestly, the bottom line is, can it get to me tomorrow, and how much does it cost? But I really do care about who&#8217;s building the thing in WordPress, and I would imagine that&#8217;s quite important, so there we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;ve probably used up enough of your time, we&#8217;re on the 45 minute mark. Just before we go, where can we find you? Drop a URL, a Twitter handle, whatever works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:55] <strong>Katie Keith:</strong> So you can find all the previous episodes of the podcast and subscribe for the future at wpproducttalk.com. To find out more about me individually, you can find me on Twitter at Katie Keith Barn2, or my company website is barn2.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:12] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, wppropducttalk.com is a great spot, and we are investing in that website a lot, which is a lot of fun actually. And I&#8217;m on Twitter at Learn with Matt C, and I also blog semi-regularly at mattcromwell.com. And of course, I want everybody to check out all the awesome things we&#8217;re doing at stellarwp.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nicely done. Thank you very much. I&#8217;ll put all of the links in the show notes, so if you head over to wptavern.com/podcast, search for the episode with Katie and Matt&#8217;s name in it, and you&#8217;ll be able to find everything there. So Katie Keith, Matt Cromwell, thank you so much for chatting to me today. That was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:45] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Thanks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieKeithBarn2\">Katie Keith</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://x.com/learnwithmattc\">Matt Cromwell</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie is the founder and CEO at Barn2 Plugins, and Matt is co-founder of GiveWP and Senior Director of Customer Experience at StellarWP. They have been running the WP Product Talk podcast together since early 2023, where they interview WordPress product owners to get the inside scoop on running a successful business in the WordPress ecosystem, and they’ve collating much of what they’ve learned on the show to create the ultimate blueprint on how to build a successful WordPress product, which they revealed during their WordCamp Europe presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the world of WordPress product development and marketing. This touches upon topics such as enhancing the WordPress admin interface with additional features that feel like a natural extension, and finding success through organic content and a consistent, user-focused, YouTube strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore important marketing strategies within the WordPress community, emphasising the value of identifying gaps in the market and leveraging event attendance for growth. Katie gives her thoughts on the power of explainer videos focused on solving user problems, and how Google and YouTube work hand-in-hand to surface relevant content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt discusses the challenges of pricing products correctly, setting expectations, and offering strategic discounts without devaluing their worth, focussing on the importance of listening to customer feedback to prioritise future product development. They both provide practical advice on creating a user-friendly product that feels like a part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of our talk, Katie and Matt get into the value of transparency and the human touch in business, the significance of an up to date &#8220;About Us&#8221; page, and their approach to face-to-face customer interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a WordPress product developer or just interested in the intricate world of WordPress business, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a

class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Adam:<br />Hey everyone, this is Adam Weeks from BizChat. Unfortunately, I am not joined by my lovely co-host, Emma Young. She is out of town, busy doing all kinds of stuff, jet-setting around the world. So you are stuck with me as your host. But good news for you. I have a really exciting guest today, Scott Stapley. He is a founder at BigScoots. You may not have heard of them before, but they&#8217;ve been around for quite a while and instead of me just telling you about them, hey Scott, welcome. It&#8217;s good to meet you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Good morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, Adam. Thanks so much. Pleasure to be here. Scott Stapley, CEO and co-founder of BigScoots, 15 years now, so it&#8217;s been a minute. Exciting though. Very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />I&#8217;m sure time flies when you&#8217;re having fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, you tell me. Yeah, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Well, Scott, in all transparency, this is kind of the first time we&#8217;re getting to meet each other, although I have met some of the people you work with and I met at CloudFest US. One of the things that really stood out to me when I was getting to know more about BigScoots and what you guys do was customer service or client service. I think more specifically, we&#8217;re going to get into some of the nuances of that. And so that&#8217;s what this episode is about. We call this the hook. We&#8217;re hooking people in. If people are curious and want to know more about customer service, client service, best in class, what should we do? We&#8217;re going to get into some of the interesting elements of best practices. Is it worth it? Is it worth the investment? When is it not? And I think people are really going to get some solid takeaways from this. But before we get into that and some of those takeaways, just kind of give us a quick introduction. Where are you at on this big planet and yeah, a little bit more about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, thanks again, Adam. Looking forward to digging into all the nitty and gritty. Me, myself, I live a small life these days in Connecticut just outside of New York. In a previous life, I did a lot of traveling, had the opportunity to live overseas for quite a while with my wife, followed her around in her ventures. But BigScoots has been a labor of love for a very long time. It&#8217;s afforded me the opportunity to work remotely and just kind of deal with the odd business trip. So I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to really explore the world. In my younger years, I went to school for cell and molecular biology of all things. It&#8217;s not all too applicable these days, but it was a fun adventure at the time. But it&#8217;s been, you talk about a career path and sort of a journey to get here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just been, you talk a little bit about the topic being customer service. We classify it as customer success. We think there&#8217;s a lot that encompasses customer service and it&#8217;s more than just the client specialists, the account manager, or the sales representative, or whoever might typically fall within that usual role. And we&#8217;ve really kind of had the opportunity to spend the better part of those 15 years really kind of focusing in on that. So that&#8217;s been an adventure and my goal for that entire period of time is to build a business and a service around a very high level of customer success. So yeah, that&#8217;s me in a nutshell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Very cool. Yeah, that&#8217;s a great intro and I really appreciate getting that background. One of the things I love about the Do the Woo community in WordPress is it&#8217;s just chock-full of interesting people with just backgrounds that you wouldn&#8217;t have expected. Oh, microbiology. Sure, WordPress. Absolutely. Let&#8217;s put those together. We all have interesting paths. So let&#8217;s jump right into customer success. From a high level, how would you define it? What is customer success? What does that look like? Let&#8217;s start from your perspective, what does that look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, and I think my perspective as a business owner might have a few facets that are perhaps a little bit different depending on the business that you might be looking at it from. For example, we have metrics these days. We have customer churn and revenue retention and these sorts of things. And you can measure client success in a certain type of way, but it&#8217;s not all too palpable. And I find having your finger on the pulse, ear to the ground, finger in the air, whichever one you&#8217;d like, is really the best way to understand the ebbs and flows of your business and make sure that you&#8217;re doing things right. If your goal is to deliver on your customer success goals, and in my case, for example, that means a lot of inbound leads. I&#8217;m spending a lot of my day on chats and sales tickets and just making sure that I understand what the customers are needing and how we can be doing better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote a small bio on my LinkedIn like 10 years ago about my job being to understand what we do well and what we can do better. And I&#8217;d say that that&#8217;s still 80, 90% of my day. Naturally, the business still needs to be run. So there&#8217;s a huge portion of my day being spent elsewhere these days. But really understanding with boots on the ground in the weeds so to speak. I mean, that&#8217;s the words that I like to use most regularly. What is actually happening? What are those first words coming out of your sales team&#8217;s fingers, I guess. How are people being greeted? Is it done so in a manner that hits your ultimate customer success goals? And it takes a lot. It takes a lot. It takes an army, it takes a team, takes a village to really do that at every corner, especially when you&#8217;re such a high-touch business like a hosting provider where you&#8217;re effectively a problem dump. People effectively only reach out to you when there&#8217;s an issue. So making sure that you have the right frame of mind and all of the information that you could possibly have available to you to address issues, whether it be billing or support related is incredibly important. So building tools, proactive measures, really training our team, finding the right people. There&#8217;s so much that goes into it, but in the weeds is staying in the weeds no matter how busy you get is extremely critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Awesome. What do you feel, why is it worth it to invest in customer service if someone was saying, Hey, we live in an age of AI is a big deal now, or we can just have lots of help articles, these are smart people, they&#8217;ll figure it out. Sell me on investing in customer service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, this could be a whole multi-hour talking in itself, but it&#8217;s ultimately what we chose to differentiate on. So it&#8217;s ultimately the core of our business. Why is our business successful in an otherwise contracting market? There&#8217;s a lot of other hosting providers who are really, really contracting in really significant ways and we&#8217;re not. We&#8217;re fortunate and lucky enough to be going in the opposite direction. And I think the core reason is what you just mentioned is our investment in customer success and our ability to sort of deliver on that. It&#8217;s not something that happened overnight. I mean you have to do it every day. You have to iterate a hundred times a week and you have to spend many, many years trying to perfect the client customer success lifecycle because it&#8217;s just so hard to do consistently every time. But if you do get it right, I mean you&#8217;re correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in a world of AI and automation and I think that&#8217;s exactly the reason why customer success is so important these days in client service because how many times have you had a random issue with whatever personal instrument or device or technology or whatever, whether it be your phone or your internet or what have you, reach out to the team, you get a bot in off hours, we&#8217;ll get back to you in four days. Here&#8217;s my email you may or may not get responded to. That&#8217;s just in my view, that is incredibly disappointing. If I have a problem, I would very much like somebody to hear me. I would love to be heard. I would love to know that somebody takes ownership over that problem and I would love for that person to actually be there present speaking to me and making sure that they understand the problem fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what we deliver on is somebody right now you could open up our chat, or this could be four o&#8217;clock in the morning on Christmas Eve and you could speak to somebody, somebody would answer you within 60 seconds, most typically, and they would listen to you, they would hear your problem and they would aim to address it as quickly and as urgently as possible. And there&#8217;s just a freeing experience in my view, when you have that type of customer success or a customer interaction from the customer side. I mean, if you interact with a business and that business, you feel heard and you feel validated and you feel that your problem is actually going to be addressed and done so quickly, that just changes everything as far as how you look at a business. And I think in a world where everything is guide based and AI written and other hosts because they are contracting or maybe pushing margins in certain forms and fashions certainly not all hosts, but it is a difficult world right now, especially in our ecosystem and investing in customer success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a very large burden there from the host to take on as far as training and hiring and maintaining tools and informing your support reps and sort of having that level of availability. So if you can deliver on that, in my opinion, and I think we&#8217;ve seen that in our business sort of lifecycle, is that people really, really, really, really grab onto that and effectively never leave because it&#8217;s difficult to find that level of attention elsewhere. And we&#8217;re not perfect, but we do care. We care a lot and people know that, and I think there&#8217;s huge value</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in it for any industry hosting or otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Interesting. Okay, great. Alright. You sold me. I&#8217;m a small business owner in WooCommerce and WordPress and yep, I believe that I need to do to invest in customer success. Where do I start? How do I get this going? I don&#8217;t have infinite resources. And if you were to take that use case, where do you start and then how do you build that out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />In our own world, I mean hosting, I don&#8217;t know, is all too different from a WooCommerce platform in the sense that there are still certain metrics and numbers and values that we need to hit internally. We were a bootstrap business. We started from the typical, here&#8217;s $20 and then it turns into a server and then the server turns into two servers and 15 years later we have our own data center footprint, but we very much were a bootstrapped, homegrown, invest the proceeds into growing type of model. And I think the difficulty for us, and I think maybe what you&#8217;re getting at is that there&#8217;s a point in time where it can&#8217;t just necessarily be you as the founder or if it is, you need to figure out is your time best spent here or is it best spent elsewhere? I was very fortunate enough to have an amazing technical founder, so my business partner and I, we had an immediate sort of splitting of responsibilities and I would attribute the great amount of success to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to focus on the business and sales and all the things in that respect. And my business partner Justin, he was able to focus on all of the technical needs of our platform effectively. So that really influenced quite a lot. So a little bit of help, to say the least, would be very helpful with respect to just understanding where your priorities lay and being able to focus on these sorts of things. But you do have to invest in it. There&#8217;s no question about it, and there&#8217;s no immediate return either. In our case, we had to really, really, really look long-term. We had a lot of really early conversations around, okay, this&#8217;s race to bottom budget market. If we bring on a hundred customers next week for a dollar, what&#8217;s that going to do to us three years from now? We have to support these folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a business planning element to it. There&#8217;s good collaboration amongst your team and there just needs to be a priority focus. Where you invest and how you invest is going to differ depending on your industry and your location and everything else. In our case, it was invest in team as much as possible, create tools and as many monitoring tools as possible so we could influence our team members to be more efficient. So in our case, for example, as a host, we proactively monitor all of our websites. It&#8217;s something unique to BigScoot. So if your website has a problem, whether it be a resource issue, an outage, what have you, we actually know about it and we react to it. So that dramatically reduces the amount of inbound because we&#8217;re reaching out to you and fixing issues before you would otherwise reach back out to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, for example, is a keystone in the way that we&#8217;ve been able to influence our support team and our customer success model because we&#8217;ve just been able to really scale service in a way that services typically unscalable. So I think you need to look at your space. How do you invest in it? I mean, it certainly depends on the particular ecosystem, but having hosted a great number of WooCommerce sites over many years, e-commerce sites and the like, we can certainly identify many folks that have rolled out that sort of platform where they have a product, they have a service offering, whatever it might be, and they pivot more towards the service route of their business and they see growth because of it. And I think they do it in a number of different ways, but this is my story. I&#8217;m sharing how I delivered on it, but I think we&#8217;re in a world where customer success and customer service is just so, so valuable. So whatever you can, I think your dollars are just amplified so much more than iterating on product or offering larger inventory. These things are great and they&#8217;re necessary for business, but the things that really get people coming back in my view is a great experience with a brand or with a business, and that typically starts and ends with customer success, or at least it does in our world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So yep. Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re just getting started and we&#8217;re going to invest in this. It&#8217;s grown beyond you as the founder, so you have a couple of options. I know that there are companies that you can hire that have a call center and you just contract with them and they&#8217;ll take care of you, and that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;ve chosen to do, I don&#8217;t believe. How do you hire for this? How do you staff something like this? Because that first person, that&#8217;s a big investment and you don&#8217;t want to get it wrong. What things have you done that maybe you feel are unique that have made your focus on client success to be successful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah. No, it&#8217;s a good question. I mean, everybody&#8217;s business is obviously different. I would say your first hire probably no matter what business you&#8217;re in, although I suppose some don&#8217;t qualify for this, but in most cases, or at least in our case for sure, your first hire relative to your size of business is always going to be your largest expense in almost any business lifecycle. Like the ability to bring on an individual to spend a full-time effort on your business and your business alone and kind of putting yourself in that frame of mind of you&#8217;re taking somebody away potentially from another business or you&#8217;re bringing them into yours and you&#8217;re doing that in a full-time. As a business owner and an entrepreneur, it&#8217;s kind of exciting and scary and you&#8217;re bringing somebody in, you&#8217;re putting all this money forward, you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to work, and there&#8217;s no immediate returns on that person either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that person is servicing customers, they&#8217;re handling support tickets, they&#8217;re doing whatever it is you might need them to be doing, but the idea of what is their amplification within your business, it&#8217;s a scary thought. When is the right time? I mean, frankly, as soon as you can afford it, in my opinion. We were in a position where we were in college at the time. I mean, to add on to my story a little bit further, I mean, we used student loans to support ourselves while we built the business, and then we did the whole thing. We really invested in ourselves. So at that time, that&#8217;s when we actually brought on somebody is really early on. So we weren&#8217;t paying ourselves. We were actually paying our employee at the time. We had one employee still with us. By the way. It&#8217;s amazing to have them here with us as long as they have, but if you can afford to bring somebody on to support you, you most definitely should because that is going to really amplify and improve your brand image in many more ways than you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will buy their direct work product, but also through just the random comments, the extra, catch it in an off hour where you may have otherwise been grabbing a sandwich. I mean, it is so easy to see the amplification of a great team once you have them sort of in your fold and you&#8217;re talking to them, you&#8217;re having team meetings, you&#8217;re seeing all the great ideas that they have after they&#8217;ve seen your clients and after they&#8217;ve seen your product. And it is just amazing to see the acceleration that you get once you start building an amazing team around you. And the earlier you can do that, the better. Now in terms of call centers and third party support and these sorts of things, I mean, there&#8217;s certainly a business model where that works. I mean, if we take a look around at most of our billion dollar competitors, I mean, they&#8217;ve created an entire conglomerates around these types of services and they&#8217;re able to drive pricing because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a winning scenario there for a lot of end users. However, there is just going to be a lack of ownership and a lack of care and concern that those individuals are going to have because they don&#8217;t live and breathe your product in the same way that an internal team member might. So it&#8217;s always going to cost you 3, 4, 5 times as much to bring somebody internal to you. But in my case, for example, we&#8217;ve had that person for over a decade, and that same person has become an extraordinarily key member of our team, has influenced so many decisions. And I mean, that&#8217;s just one example. I mean, every team member has their own influence in our team, but bringing that person on as early as possible has just allowed us to make more better decisions more often than we otherwise could have by ourselves. Having a call center, you&#8217;re not going to get that same type of experience. So that&#8217;s our position. But certainly there&#8217;s many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, it does go to the thing that the end of the day it&#8217;s about people and investing in people makes all the difference. Finding the right people for your team. When you&#8217;re looking for people who are going to fill that customer, that client success role, are there any specific attributes that you&#8217;re looking for? Is it technical? Is it they seem nice? What is it that you&#8217;re looking for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, a bit of both, but you need a good culture fit. Most certainly. I mean, our team is large enough these days that you&#8217;re always going to find great partnership, great collaboration with other team members around you. The key that we&#8217;ve found really for bringing people on, everybody&#8217;s human at the end of the day, and the more welcoming and the more collaborative and the more approachable you are as a business owner and as a team who&#8217;s onboarding that individual, I find the larger chance of success that that person gets acclimated and just loves their position and really gets on board with the company. And I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p>just sort of that human nature of really being welcoming and offering that person the opportunity that you would otherwise want to be offered if given that kind of turn of tables just influences that chance of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much, much, much more. So when we&#8217;re looking for new hires, we really look for somebody who&#8217;s eager and motivated to get into something new, something that they might not have seen before, because that is ultimately the type of service we offer. We offer something different. We offer this really high touch, really handholding, we call it site-specific management where we&#8217;re actually logging into the WordPress platform. We&#8217;re influencing actually plugin changes and updates and stuck PHP processes and all the rest of it. And you really need somebody who&#8217;s motivated and eager to take those extra steps. Somebody reaches out to you with a problem, maybe they can&#8217;t log into their email, something a little bit more basic. Take that opportunity or take that touch point and that opportunity upon you to also, let&#8217;s take a look around. Let&#8217;s make sure their caching is enabled properly. Let&#8217;s make sure there&#8217;s no security concerns or outdated plugin or something that we could otherwise do more for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that person doesn&#8217;t necessarily need any additional technical expertise to be able to do that. But if they are eager and if they are motivated, that&#8217;s where you really start to see that winning combination. When we look for individuals, we certainly need the WordPress technical expertise and Linux system administration as well. Those are sort of the kind of keynotes of what we do here. However, we can train to a senior capacity because we have so much team collaboration, and ultimately it&#8217;s called a deep bench. We don&#8217;t have an influx of replied-to tickets. We don&#8217;t have this scenario where we don&#8217;t have time to spend with new onboards, so we can really spend the time and effort to train from a technical perspective. What we can&#8217;t do is get somebody excited about customer success and customer service in the same way that they might otherwise bring to the table. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking for. I mean, that&#8217;s kind of a certain respect and non-answer, but we really, it&#8217;s hard to define that too. A resume doesn&#8217;t necessarily do it in interviews. Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to really perceive, but if you can get the energy out of that individual, I mean that&#8217;s worth everything regardless of their technical position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, thank you. From the client perspective, I&#8217;ve got a problem, something&#8217;s not working, I don&#8217;t understand, and so I&#8217;m going to reach out and I want this problem fixed. I&#8217;m looking for a person, I&#8217;m looking for someone who&#8217;s going to fix it quickly, but I&#8217;m not necessarily looking to make a best friend. I just need this thing fixed. My business is in jeopardy, it&#8217;s late at night. I&#8217;m struggling over it. What are maybe some of the types of things you do? Are there any investments? Are there any tools that you&#8217;re using that maybe unique that can help a customer get their problem solved quicker? And I&#8217;ll even throw out some words like is AI, is there some tool there that might make it faster? You&#8217;re still dealing with a person or what types of things that are you investing in to make that experience? Or is it just no, this person is good and can answer your question. Any special tools or just curious about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, so not to fire too many people up here, but AI is not smart enough to identify human problems and website issues to the extent that they need to be. I mean, there&#8217;s multiple variables. There&#8217;s a server level, there&#8217;s a site level, there&#8217;s a network level. You need start using edge components. You start using object caching. You start using site, page caching, cache, excluding. There&#8217;s so many elements to this that AI cannot really influence to that extent. What AI can be used for. I mean, just to specifically note on that AI conversation is it can digest data and spit out some great results. So in our case, the way that we&#8217;re leveraging AI, for example, is in a similar capacity to what you had just mentioned. So we have what I would distinguish as just support gold, like a golden bank of support tickets. We have over a million fully answered completed support tickets, and every single one of those has an extensive amount of detail in a lot of cases, very unique attributes to each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being able to digest that amount of data and spit out some key results related to a potential issue, all on the admin side, just to influence the atom, creative support efficiency, create tools. Understanding is custom scripts, custom excludes, RegX, whatever the case might be. We&#8217;ve probably seen it before. And AI can help accelerate support responses by just having a database that they can ultimately freely and a very flexible search. That&#8217;s really kind of full stop as far as AI is concerned. On our end, we feel very strongly that everything else needs to come from a human, however, tools can influence them. So AI is a tool the way that we see it. I mentioned proactive monitoring being a keynote. So for example, if you reach out to us, we would&#8217;ve identified we could slow chase the PHP logs. We could do these things in advance of you reaching out to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an ideal world, in most cases, we&#8217;ll reach out to you. So that&#8217;ll fix a step there. But we&#8217;re influencing our admins by providing them meaningful data, meaningful tools, meaningful monitoring to be able to really accelerate and create efficiency around support. So we do a lot, there&#8217;s well over a hundred variations on these tools that we create. Happy to go into detail on all of them, but it&#8217;s really about, yes, it&#8217;s about creating tools, about creating monitoring, and that therefore influences customer success as well. If you have these tools and you have this efficiency, your response time goes down, your response detail goes up, and your ability to really solve problems for customers is that much quicker. I would also add that freeing of time and that efficiency is really a key way in which we&#8217;ve been able to amplify our service. So as an example, if a customer approaches us, I mean, a very common thing with WooCommerce being that WooCommerce is highly dynamic is that it eats up a lot of CPU resources within the hosting environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CPU is going to be your bottleneck. CPU is also very expensive. That&#8217;s how everything is effectively classed in the cloud community is you have a certain level of CPU, you&#8217;ll get more memory, you&#8217;ll get outsized storage. You&#8217;ll be paying for these additional resources that you ultimately don&#8217;t need. PHP workers are also kind of couched within that as well. Ultimately, CPU is your core resource. Do you necessarily need to upgrade the CPU every time you have a slow admin page or a 22nd cart checkout? I mean, the answer is most definitely no. There&#8217;s a lot of different ways in which certain plugins interact with the cart. For example, are you caching or excluding the right things on various pages? Are you influencing the way in which PHP processes actually run or get completed? Are you creating the right optimizations in the database when you actually need to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, all these things are best addressed by a seasoned system admin who has seen where WooCommerce and WordPress and Linux a million times over. It&#8217;s very difficult to acquire that type of high touch in the hosting world for reasons we&#8217;ve already talked about. But being able to reach out to somebody, have those people, have tools that have already informed them of these various issues and have the ability to dive deeper into them without necessarily taking support time away from other people is kind of the recipe to success as it pertains to customer success. So I mean, we originally started talking about customer success and how we&#8217;re able to deliver on it. We&#8217;ve really formed a whole business around it. I mean, creating tools, owning our own infrastructure, building out our own network. I mean, everything comes down to being able to offer better service, whether it be creating efficiency, opening up margins, whatever it is, it&#8217;s all coming back and reinvested into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So that is an interesting point that you brought up about and how I typically think of customer client success as we&#8217;ve been talking about, as I have a problem, so let me reach out to this company that I have a contract with because I need something fixed, something&#8217;s broken. And what you&#8217;re all mentioning is that, well, of course, yes, that in addition to we can reach out proactively and maybe solve something before it comes a problem. I imagine that there&#8217;s a couple of potential issues there with like, wait, why are they calling me? Are they just trying to sell me something? How do you think about this idea of proactively kind of being this partner in their business and helping solve problems before they become problems without being salesy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, sometimes it can be tricky. I mean, the hosting piece of it is interesting. So I mentioned to you the most critical issue and your bottleneck most typically in all WooCommerce-related problems comes down to CPU. If you could have an infinite amount of CPU, it almost doesn&#8217;t matter how poorly your theme interacts with various plugins in your checkout and so forth. But infinite CPU is not realistic. Also, as you scale your CPU into more cores to allow more visitors and more threads to interact with that CPU in the PHP, you&#8217;re going to end up with a much slower CPU clock speed as well. So it&#8217;s kind of like an inverse thought process. You upgrade your CPU, but what you&#8217;re actually ending up with is a slower responding site. Maybe the issue of the actual timeouts gets fixed, but it might take a ten-second load time to a 22nd load time, and that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you address this? We have a baseline. So again, kind of all circling back to customer success, but we build and maintain our own infrastructure. We&#8217;ve been infrastructure providers. We haven&#8217;t talked about this, but we started out as infrastructure providers. We provided and infrastructure management for companies in the Chicago land area who at the time that predates AWS and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Azure and what have you. So we would take what would otherwise be a locally hosted platform like a hospital or what have you, and it we&#8217;d manage that infrastructure and we would do it with this sort of enterprise level of service, saw the writing on the wall, and we pivoted towards WordPress because we love WordPress. We love the idea of building, working around folks who actually own and operate these sites and just working in this ecosystem. It&#8217;s where we want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We knew that from day one, we took that enterprise platform and that sort of enterprise sales and service mentality brought it into WordPress, and that that&#8217;s kind of the starting to our customer success story, but owning our own infrastructure and being that infrastructure provider makes us unique. And that&#8217;s one of the key ways in which we deliver on WooCommerce in particular is because if you own and operate your infrastructure, you don&#8217;t have to deal with, let&#8217;s call it the cloud margin problem, where you&#8217;re getting a three or four X negative return on your CPU resource. So if you&#8217;re an individual, and what I mean by that is that if you scale up your, let&#8217;s call it just an AWS instance for the sake of just conversation, what you&#8217;re going to end up with is you&#8217;re going to end up with a much larger platform with resources that you otherwise don&#8217;t need and perhaps are not optimized to the extent that they otherwise should be.<br />So are your PHP processes optimized? Your database is optimized, so on and so forth. If you build out your own platform and you do so with more CPU resources that are more resource efficient, in addition to optimizing the platform itself like the WordPress environment and WooCommerce, you kind of come at this from a double-edged sword where you optimize the running processes, but you also optimize the actual physical resources themselves. And just having that as a baseline creates a lot of proactive service improvements as well. For example, the salesy or marketing numbers that we use is if you were to reduce your footprint from a cloud-based managed WordPress provider to an infrastructure-based cloud-based, managed WordPress provider, you&#8217;re going to see about three or four times the resources for the same dollar spent. So it&#8217;s just sort of baked into the model to offer more service focused improvements, and that just comes through more resource efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of proactive services that we can do there, and that&#8217;s not really salesy or marketing, it&#8217;s just the nature in which our business operates. We&#8217;ve sort of taken what is otherwise a problem to manage the infrastructure. We&#8217;ve taken that burden on ourselves and we benefit the end user by providing that to them. We don&#8217;t charge them more, we don&#8217;t provide less reliability. We don&#8217;t take any negatives out of that. We just take that on as a challenge. We offer that, and in turn, it improves the service lifecycle for a customer as well. So I think there&#8217;s a number of different avenues that you can do that sort of thing in various different industries and ecosystems. You can own a piece of the problem that is otherwise deferred off to a third party or maybe the end user themselves. You improve it, you validate it, you own it for them, and it nets benefits to everybody. I mean, in your case, you get the service wins. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />What I kind of distill that down into is be a partner, solve problems like they&#8217;ve, the customer has trusted you with this part of their business and being a good steward of that trust. Is that what I&#8217;m hearing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, certainly. I mean, I love the word partner. It&#8217;s what we use all this time. It&#8217;s what I use. We expect to be a partner rather than just a service provider. I mean, we don&#8217;t want to be the people that you just call once every 24 months because your credit card expires and you need to update your billing or something. We want to be somebody that you&#8217;re leaning on regularly, especially in the context of WooCommerce, because things are always changing. If you fix a problem with WooCommerce, like a lot of these websites, these heavy traffic websites that really have a lot of focus on performance. If you fix a problem, you could be let&#8217;s kind of turning the dials ever so slightly, a PP update, a plugin update. We have to remember that WooCommerce is a community solution. So every single plugin is created by a different developer that doesn&#8217;t necessarily test against other development pipelines and PP updates might, the plugin update might lag behind a PHP update. There could be any number of variety, even reasons why something might fall out of sync again. So just being that partner and just ensuring that you&#8217;re always there to be helpful is absolutely critical. For sure. I mean, customer success is not reasonably attainable or high level of customer success without meaningful partnership and really being invested in your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That&#8217;s very cool, Scott. Well, I feel like this is a topic that we could just keep talking about for a really long time. We don&#8217;t have a really long time. We&#8217;re wrapping up getting close to being done here. Before we do, if someone, like I said, we could keep talking about this if they wanted to, like Hey, want to get in touch with you at Big Scoots, I&#8217;ve got more questions. Scott, you said something on the Do the Woo podcast that really sparked my interest. How would they get in touch with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Me personally, I&#8217;m just as available as the rest of our team. Bottom right hand corner of our website, talk to a human. Hey, I saw Scott. I&#8217;d love to talk to him. You&#8217;ll find me separate to that, scott@bigscoots.com. Always happy to give out my personal email. I&#8217;ve always been chained to the hip as far as my email and myself goes. So if there&#8217;s anything I can do to help answer any questions regardless of coming over to Big Scoots or not, I mean, I&#8217;m just very happy to be a part of the community help where I can, if I can offer any advice or any help whatsoever, very happy to. But I mean, thank you very much for having me on. Always love talking about this stuff. As you can probably guess, pretty passionate about customer success. I mean, that&#8217;s how we built our whole business. So there&#8217;s a lot of mistakes that we&#8217;ve made over time. I like to think that we&#8217;ve had enough of a timeline to rectify those mistakes and improve on them quite dramatically. So time has been on our side. We&#8217;re excited to be here, excited to be in the community. It was awesome to meet you. I didn&#8217;t meet you, but James mentioned about your conversation that was awesome at CloudFest, so just happy to really engage, be more part of the community as much as we can. So just get in touch, reach out happy. Happy to help if I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Sounds good. And hopefully we&#8217;ll be seeing some more Big Scoots at some of the different WordCamp and CloudFest events that are coming up here soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Yeah, WordCamp US will be there. If anybody else is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Portland&#8217;s going to be fun. Yeah, I just got my plane tickets and it&#8217;s going to a good time. Well, thank you everybody for joining us. This has been another episode of BizChat from the Do the Woo. We hope you guys have had a great day and that you learned something. We&#8217;ll see you guys soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott:<br />Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo BizChat</em></strong>, host <strong>Adam Weeks</strong> welcomes <strong>Scott Stapley, CEO and co-founder of BigScoots</strong>. Scott shares his insights on the importance of customer success, defining it as a proactive approach that goes beyond traditional customer service. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He discusses BigScoots&#8217; journey from a bootstrap business to a major player in the hosting industry, emphasizing their unique focus on personalized, high-touch support. The conversation moves into the challenges and rewards of investing in customer success, the role of AI, and the significance of building a dedicated, motivated team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott also highlights the value of being a true partner to clients, solving issues proactively, and maintaining a commitment to exceptional service. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Customer Success</strong>: The importance of customer success is highlighted, emphasizing its role in long-term business growth and client retention. It goes beyond just solving problems; it&#8217;s about creating a proactive and personalized experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proactive Service</strong>: By monitoring and addressing issues before they become problems, companies can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce the need for reactive support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Investment</strong>: Investing in the right team is essential. Hiring people who are motivated and align with the company&#8217;s culture can significantly amplify customer success efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Role of AI</strong>: While AI can help with data analysis and support efficiency, the human touch is irreplaceable for addressing complex issues and providing personalized service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Infrastructure Ownership</strong>: Owning and managing infrastructure can provide significant advantages in resource efficiency and service reliability, especially for hosting providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Partner Approach</strong>: Treating customers as partners rather than just service recipients fosters trust and long-term relationships. Being a proactive and reliable partner can differentiate a business in a competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long-Term Investment</strong>: Building a robust customer success framework takes time and consistent effort. The benefits include higher customer loyalty, better retention rates, and positive word-of-mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adaptability and Iteration</strong>: Continuously iterating on processes and tools based on customer feedback and needs is vital for maintaining high levels of service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer-Centric Model</strong>: A customer-centric approach, focusing on individual needs and tailored solutions, can lead to exceptional service experiences and business growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Engaging with the community and being accessible to customers can strengthen relationships and enhance the company&#8217;s reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-stapley-0b519023/\"><strong>Scott on LinkedIn</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigscoots.com/\">BigScoots.com</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Aug 2024 09:06:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"HeroPress: A Journalist’s Journey into WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=7269\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:146:\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-journalists-journey-into-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-journalists-journey-into-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10730:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/081224-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I’ve found a way to blend my love of writing and tech—and I have WordPress to thank for that.\" /><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-small-town-girl\">Small town girl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Friends and family who know me well aren’t surprised that I publish The Repository, a weekly email about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, I grew up in Zeehan, a one-way street of a town on the west coast of Tasmania, the island that’s at the bottom of Australia. The population at the time was around 2,000 and everyone knew everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Dad worked at the nearby tin mine and my Mum wrangled me and my two younger brothers while working as a bookkeeper and volunteering at the local neighbourhood centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad loved gadgets. He was always following us around with whatever video camera was new at the time. He bought a CD player when they were first released (John Farnham was high on rotation). He also bought an Amiga 600 (I was obsessed with Golden Axe and Lemmings).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It wasn’t long before our computer was replaced with a Windows 95 machine. When Mum wasn’t doing her word processing, I was writing stories. I loved stories and had my heart set on working at a newspaper one day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At 14, I started helping out with the weekly community newsletter. Locals would drop off their submissions at shops around town and then I’d design each A5 booklet in Microsoft Publisher, print them off and fold them. Locals could then buy a copy for 20 cents. It was fun for a while but man, folding and stapling several dozen copies was a chore! I received an Australia Day Community Award for my efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing and designing the newsletter led to playing with web pages and teaching myself HTML and CSS. Since we didn’t have the internet at home, I saved up my pocket money to buy those magazines you could get with CDs attached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 18, I went to university. I clearly recall speaking to a journalism lecturer at an open day about my interest in completing an arts degree with a double major in journalism and computer science. She laughed and asked, “Why would you want to do that?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess my Mum’s stubbornness also rubbed off on me. I graduated with my degree (and double major!) and went on to work as a newspaper reporter for Fairfax and later News Ltd. I loved working as a journalist. As much as I enjoyed reporting rounds and covering politics for a while, it was a joy and a privilege writing other people’s stories when I moved to community news reporting and editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all good things must come to an eye. I eventually left news reporting, disillusioned that I was working harder than ever for a wage that would never buy me a house, and I was filing stories that were half-finished because they had to go up ASAP for social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-hello-wordpress\">Hello WordPress!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was time to explore my other major. I landed a job writing for WPMU DEV, a main-stay of the WordPress business community. It was my first time working professionally with WordPress after many years creating websites for family, friends and community groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned a lot. I had the writing chops and knew how to use WordPress (I’d come a long way since my hand-coding days!), but it was a baptism of fire learning to become a power user and create top-notch content for our mostly agency and freelancer audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Not long after starting at WPMU DEV, I went to my first WordCamp, WordCamp Melbourne 2013. Walking into the event, I felt way out of my depth, especially as I’m an introvert attending alone. I stayed for a couple of sessions and then left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Australia, it’s not easy getting to WordCamps because they’re so far away! Not to be put off by my first experience, I went to WordCamp Europe 2015 in Seville, Spain, and had an incredible time hanging out with colleagues, meeting new people, and melting in the extreme heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suffice to say, WPMU DEV was a fun place to work, but eventually it was time to move on. I was ready to go out on my own and launched Words By Birds, a copy and content studio. I worked mostly with WordPress businesses, producing high-quality content, copywriting and strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favourite clients was MailPoet, headed up at the time by co-founder Kim Gjerstad. We clicked immediately. We’d both worked as journalists and talked a lot about starting some kind of newsletter together that focused on WordPress news. Eventually, we stopped talking and started doing. On November 8, 2019, we sent the first issue of The Repository to 49 subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim handled the business and marketing side of things while I focused on writing. We were a great team, and it’s a collaboration I’m very grateful for, especially in hindsight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not too long into The Repository’s history, I took a few weeks off to focus on another important project. My son was born in February 2020, and you can guess what happens next. As the COVID-19 pandemic kicked off, it felt like the world went into hibernation with me. I happily spent my days at home learning to be a mum without the pressure of the outside world. It felt like great timing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that lasted six weeks. Soon, I was back at it, writing The Repository. I read articles and scrolled social media during the week and spent Fridays writing. With a newborn often attached to me, I had to find creative ways to write. When my son was really little, I could pop him in a wrap and wear him while I typed at my kitchen table. I wrote while he napped. I wrote at night. I even wrote with only one hand when I needed to breastfeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all good businesses in the WordPress space, MailPoet was acquired. Kim graciously gave me his share in The Repository and left WordPress to work on other things. It was also around this time that my career took a turn and I stopped working full-time in the WordPress space. For the next five years, I headed up communications and marketing for a creative tech company and then worked in local government, leading the design excellence narrative for the city where I now live, Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>While my head was in other worlds Monday to Thursday, my heart was in WordPress and The Repository on Fridays. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like both a privilege and a burden. I mean, who wants to spend their Fridays working to deadline? While I loved, loved, loved digging into the WordPress space every week and writing about it, I also loathed missing out on dinners with friends, long weekends away with my incredibly supportive husband, and – more often than not – working late into the night. Still, I continued to do it because I couldn’t let go (thanks for passing on your stubbornness, Mum).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cue-career-crisis\">Cue: career crisis</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of 2024, I was at a crossroads. The Repository was taking longer to write because news sources were drying up (I’m looking at you WPTavern) forcing me to spend longer researching stories and often having to write more to fill in the gaps. What used to take a day to write was taking two days to write. Meanwhile, my job outside of WordPress was fine but I wasn’t passionate about it. I was good at it but I didn’t <em>feel</em> good about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>WordCamps have a funny way of putting things into perspective. Amid my career crisis, I booked tickets to WordCamp Asia 2024 in Taipei, Taiwan, and I’m so glad I did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking into the venue, one of the first people I ran into was Adam Warner from GoDaddy, whose sponsorship of The Repository through the pandemic ensured I could keep it running. I met Birgit Pauli-Haack from Automattic for the first time and it felt like catching up with an old friend. I found myself sitting next to fellow Melburnian Lawrence Ladomery from WP BizDev at the marketing table on Contributor Day. I caught up with Lesley Sim from Newsletter Glue, whose perspective on business I greatly admire – she has a great way of cutting through the crap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was fun meeting Nathan Wrigley from WP Builds in the media room (and fangirling over each other’s work!). I got a chance to sit down with the very impressive Miriam Schwab from Elementor. I later ran into Human Made’s Ryan McCue, another Aussie, who bailed me up in a cafe for an insightful chat after he saw my Repository-branded tote bag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of day two, feeling tired and social-ed out, I went to the food hall at Taipei 101 for a quick dinner but ran into Guildenberg’s Jonathan Wold (and Lesley again!) who talked me through my business. Last but not least, on day two, I had the pleasure of having lunch with Bob Dunn of Do the Woo fame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah, I’m name-dropping. I met and spoke to a lot of people at WordCamp Asia, but it was these people – who I admire and respect – whose invaluable advice led me to realise I needed to go home and quit my job and get back to working with WordPress. So I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-future\">The future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. I still publish The Repository. In fact, I’m expanding it to publish proper news articles on the website soon. The email newsletter isn’t going anywhere – after five years, I’m very much attached to it and can’t wait to make it shorter and punchier once I can link to longer stories on the website. I have a vision for the next 12 months and I’m excited to see how things pan out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d like to think my younger self would be proud of what I’m doing today. I’ve found a way to blend my love of writing and tech—and I have WordPress, and the generosity of spirit that defines WordPress people, to thank for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to that lecturer who thought I was silly to study journalism <em>and</em> computer science, well, who’s laughing now?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-journalists-journey-into-wordpress/\">A Journalist’s Journey into WordPress</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 10:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Rae Morey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"Do The Woo Community: Diving into WordPress 6.6 with Insights from Mary Baum and Meher Bala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85113\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://dothewoo.io/diving-into-wordpress-6-6-with-insights-from-mary-baum-and-meher-bala/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42208:\"Episode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Abha:<br />Hello and welcome to the WordPress Way. It&#8217;s Do the Woo time yet again. You&#8217;re here with Abha Thakor and we&#8217;re talking about all things WordPress as you would expect. But more importantly we&#8217;re talking about the new release 6.6 just out and we&#8217;ve got lots of things to share. But also in this episode we thought we would answer some of the questions that you&#8217;ve all been sending in about how to get involved, how to get past the worry about getting involved, and also some of the tips from people who have been engaged in the recent processes. So a little bit more different than our usual release series, but at the end of the year in November, we will be doing a reflection on all the releases of this year and a bit more technical stuff too. So make sure you join us for that. In the studio today, we&#8217;re doing some globetrotting again, we&#8217;ve got Meher Bala joining us direct from India, and we have Mary Baum joining us from the US. Hello ladies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Hello ladies. Hey everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />So thank you both for joining. I know you probably had quite a lot of 6.6 in your heads for the last few weeks. Meher, you&#8217;ve been the release coordinator for this major release and the first time as a release coordinator, not just shadowing so much, been a very exciting time. And Mary, you&#8217;ve been leading Marcos and also being involved with some other component stuff, so it&#8217;s really great to have you both with us and we&#8217;re going to have some conversations today also about component maintenance and those who listen regularly to the show, know that we often talk about all the different ways that you can get involved with WordPress because it is our software and our project and that&#8217;s for everybody, wherever you are around the world. So we&#8217;re going to touch on those things a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Coming off a release coordinating of six five, I cannot be more proud of Meher who did an absolutely phenomenal job with the release of 6.6, and it was not easy and my heart just sings for the great job you did and for you in general, you are a rising star.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Thank you. Thank you for inviting me to the show. Going from Marcomms to release coordinator, it&#8217;s different but it&#8217;s new. It&#8217;s something different in a release than doing Marcomms</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha <br />And I think that&#8217;s one of the things we want to get across today is that you don&#8217;t have to just get involved in a release in the areas of where you are professionally working. It can also be in another area that you want to develop and there are so many jobs in release. It doesn&#8217;t have to be just on the squad. A squad is an amazing place to be, but actually it&#8217;s a whole community that brings the release together and there are so many opportunities and Maher&#8217;s going to share some of the testing ones a bit later in this show as well. So ladies, I&#8217;m going to start with some of my favorite things from the release and as previous docs co-lead and Marcos and having been involved in various other bits of the release this time, it was really interesting to be focusing a bit more on the component side and to see some of the things that people have been talking about and wanting and we haven&#8217;t quite got there as a community to achieve in previous releases, but to be in this, one of the things we&#8217;re going to start with is the site editor experience in WordPress because it really has transformed in recent releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />And I think that&#8217;s one of the things we want to get across today is that you don&#8217;t have to just get involved in a release in the areas of where you are professionally working.

One of the things we&#8217;re going to start with is the site editor experience in WordPress because it really has transformed in recent releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />I just redid Support Inclusion in Tech website over the weekend, mostly the typography and I&#8217;ve still got a couple of things, but I did change the theme to 2024 and we were already on 6.6. I&#8217;m using the grid layout on the homepage, extensive use of the font library from 6.5, smoothed out and refined in 6.6, and we redid the header, we redid everything and everything is so much smoother. I&#8217;ve never redone an entire design in a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It is a lot slicker and a lot quicker now with the new facilities that we have quicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />And quicker and quicker, and things take the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Which is really important that when you get things that work when you first do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Yeah, yeah. Yes. As somebody who has tried to estimate how long something&#8217;s going to take and been off by a factor of five or ten, and then having to do things over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Also with the layouts. Mary, you&#8217;ve been talking about negative spacing. Do you want to share a little bit about why that is useful? Because as a term people might think, well what is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Well, as an example is that the way we&#8217;re doing testimonials. Winstina Hughes is the founder of Support Inclusion in Tech, which does pair up WordCamp speakers with funding to get them travel. So when you&#8217;ve been picked to speak then you can submit an application and get matched with a company who can underwrite your travel expenses on the same continent. So no flying over oceans at this moment to make the best use of the resources. But at any rate, we had testimonials on the homepage and we have the person&#8217;s name at one side and then underneath, which makes it a subhead instead of a kicker. Yes, I am a typography addict and to get the little subhead close enough to the headline that they fit together as a unit, we need to make the top margin on the subhead zero and sometimes we need to make the bottom margin on the headline negative just to get them close enough together. In other cases you might want to have two pictures overlapping. You need to have one or the other have margins that are perhaps negative one REM or negative two rems to have them open. Let&#8217;s say you want to do a Venn diagram, particularly a Venn diagram in a pattern, where you will have text inside the parts of the circle that overlap and the parts that don&#8217;t, that change. For that matter,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />you might have that as a locked pattern that you then or a synced pattern that you then can override by changing that text and just have that ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />WordPress 6.6 introduces these negative margins and the custom shadows, and it really does help you make those eye popping designs and because you can add them directly in the editor for the blocks that support those margin controls, you&#8217;ve got so much more flexibility. You could do this before with the theme JSON, which allows you to create all these overlapping elements, but to be able to do it in the way we can do it now is so much quicker. As Mary has said, it just keeps getting quicker and quicker. We also have these featured image blocks so that we can use customizable block shadows and all of this just helps us to make these pages look a little bit better, but also gives a little bit more control to our end users. Speaking of end users, if you are wanting to know more about how to do something or if you want to even write documentation for end users because you love a new feature, the documentation team will absolutely welcome you to come and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />And they&#8217;re still working on the documentation for 6.6 as they do at every release and their work is amazing and they have contributors from across the world, so do get in touch if you want to be put into contact with them and we&#8217;ll put the links in the show guide as well. I&#8217;m just going to go over to Meher. Meher, obviously in a release like this when you&#8217;re not just, you&#8217;re incorporating lots of the Gutenberg releases that have happened before and you&#8217;re hoping somethings will land, you keep testing. What is that like being release coordinator?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Being a Release coordinator for any Word press release, it&#8217;s a little tough and exciting at the same time because you have to keep a track on what is going to land and what is not going to land due to any tech issues, which will cause a lot of sites to stop working or break. The role of the release coordinator just to check in with all the teams to make sure everything is on track. If something is getting pulled out from the release for whatever reasons, it&#8217;s informed to the world that before the release this is not going to be there. So people don&#8217;t have that expectation that they want to see this feature and the feature is not available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It is that moving feast, isn&#8217;t it? And it really is that live environment, which is amazing, exciting, very stressful at times I&#8217;m sure, but also being part of a bigger picture. So Meher, before you joined as release coordinator, obviously you work as a senior developer already using WordPress. Did you know what was involved in a release? Did you have a concept of how it came together, the amount of people that were involved and the amount of testing that it included?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Right now, yes, because I have been a part of multiple releases in the past, but when I first came into the release in 5.6 in the documentation team, I was not aware of what goes into a release. I used to read occasionally the release parties but sometimes it gets too late at my end, occasionally just used to read it but not participate. But from 5.6, I became part of the squad. I got to know which teams are there, what roles individuals play, and how does the entire release take place. Becoming a release coordinator was helpful because I&#8217;ve already done a lot of releases as a Marcomms Co-Lead after 5.7. It was a new experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And I think it really does make a difference If you&#8217;ve shadowed before, I think I&#8217;ve been involved now in releases since 4.7 and every release you learn more and you learn from other people, which is one of the beauties of working and contributing to WordPress is that you have that opportunity. And the same with WooCommerce. We&#8217;ve got a fantastic community growing around us and Do The Woo and being part of that learning experience for yourself as well as others is a challenge, but it&#8217;s also very, very satisfying. So Meher, when you put together a release like the ones that you&#8217;ve been just doing recently, what&#8217;s the feeling when as a developer when you take your release hat off and you go back to look at the release. As a developer, what is the feeling that you have when you first find a new WordPress release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />As a developer, once a release is out, for me it is like what new I can implement in my existing client site, how can I make it better or what can I propose to a new client who&#8217;s coming to me with issues from their website, how can I make things better for the end user? Be it e-commerce side, be it a block side, be it a magazine side, be it just a simple brochure side. So each new feature of any release helps me think how certain aspects can be better website and how it can help the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />So really it&#8217;s an opportunity. And do you think that looking at that, if you are a storefront with a website on Woo or a Cat blogger or anybody who uses WordPress, people who use it as their detailed international intranet, that releases present opportunities and maybe not for the immediate, but something that they can take up later on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Yes, not all the features help instantly, but there will be some features which will work as soon as the release ends and in the day-to-day life of a developer or a user or a person who&#8217;s just using WordPress to share their updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Now I know Meher, you use a lot of the Gutenberg releases and some of them before they go into Core as well. What do you see as the main advantage for people now that we do get so many Gutenberg releases coming into core and being part of that major release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />I have only a couple of sites which I use direct Gutenberg on, the others all features come when added to the WordPress core. For the sites which I&#8217;m using Gutenberg, it&#8217;s like an experiment to see what advantage will these bring when it&#8217;s added to the core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And I think that&#8217;s a good way of looking at it. It&#8217;s a way of helping people really understand what&#8217;s their experiment if they&#8217;d like to beforehand, but once it becomes part of core, it is much more seamless and having that is a great thing. So in 6.6 we have this automatic plugin rollbacks now and that plugin management that we have really does make it so much safer to be able to try new things, try the plugins. I&#8217;m going to go to you, Mary, because I know this is something that you&#8217;ve been really wanting to see in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;ve tested it a bit and I have some involvement and been watching the ticket. The kicker is that it is not optional if a plugin update is an automatic or otherwise, but I think mostly automatic. If something happens and you get a fatal error with an automatic plugin update, it automatically will revert to the plugin version that worked. So there&#8217;s no reason not to turn on auto updates, and that in turn makes not only your site but the entire web more secure. It just does, and I&#8217;m saying that personally because the official position is not to claim that plugin updates necessarily make sites more secure. The fact is, well particularly now when a lot of security issues are not coming from automatic are not coming from outdated plugins, they&#8217;re coming from compromised credentials. The fact is that abandoned plugins, and in this case I&#8217;m going to mean, I&#8217;m going to say abandoned by the site owner who&#8217;s not updating them. The plugins are doing a fine job of keeping everything updated. If you for whatever reason are not checking in with your site regularly and plugins, updating themes, updating core, you do become vulnerable because let&#8217;s face it, at 43% of the web we are the open web&#8217;s last great hope. We are the open web, so it&#8217;s up to us to make it as easy as possible to keep sites current and to keep security up. It&#8217;s that simple and this is a way for upgrading everything to be a no-brainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha <br />Thanks Mary and Mary, you&#8217;re also a component maintainer. In fact, we both have a couple of components in common too. Can we both contribute to some of those maintaining, and I was very excited to see some of the bulk edit component maintenance items in this time and to see things that we&#8217;ve been really wanting to move forward actually getting there. So Mary, could you just share why people should volunteer to help on a component?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Again, it&#8217;s everything we can keep maintained and keep updated. We contribute to the security of the open web. Somebody once said to me, why do I volunteer my time to organizations I care about, because I am selfish and greedy, it makes me feel good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Also improves what we&#8217;re doing. So if you are thinking that there&#8217;s tickets that you want to see and they&#8217;re all in the same area, then have a look at what that component is. Is this something that you can help? There&#8217;s normally quite a few maintainers for each component. They all have different skills. Sometimes you&#8217;re just trying to get people to collaborate on something and help push something forward. Other times you&#8217;re looking at the code, sometimes you&#8217;re looking at patches. There is so much variety that you can get involved with, and we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes to some of those places too and we&#8217;ll put a little bit of a guide as well about how you can get involved with that because at Do the Woo, we try to be part of that collaboration and encouragement journey as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />What I&#8217;m saying is, if you want to be a part of any component and you don&#8217;t know where to get started or you don&#8217;t want to ask question because you feel that it may not be the right appropriate question. But I&#8217;ll always encourage you to ask questions because all questions are great questions. There&#8217;s a lot of documentation in the handbook which helps a normal user or beginner user to get started with how to submit a patch or how to take a look at the number of components. We have because we have a lot of components which goes into the entire WordPress software. So just ask questions or just read the handbook and you get answers. Otherwise you can always put your questions on the Make WordPress Slack and someone will respond and guide you to the right documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Also, the next time you&#8217;re in the Admin, click on what&#8217;s new and you&#8217;ll see four things. You&#8217;ll see the credits, you&#8217;ll see the four freedoms, you&#8217;ll see something else, but there&#8217;s a fourth button called Get Involved was started. That was a ticket that was opened more than 10 years ago by a friend of someone who was recently Marketing team rep, and it was just committed a year ago by one of our co-maintainers. So there&#8217;s another reason to become a component maintainer, and if you click on that button there will be a bunch of concrete steps you can take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Absolutely. And also if you&#8217;re in the Admin , you can see on the right hand side details of meetups. Now there&#8217;s WordPress meetups all over the place and all over the world and it&#8217;s a great way to get involved and find out more. And many of the meetups at the moment are doing features on 6.6, so make sure you check those out too. We&#8217;re going to have some links in the show notes too to a wonderful video by Anne &#8211; who normally joins us for these releases and unfortunately can&#8217;t be here today and &#8211; all about negative margins grid block and custom shadows and it&#8217;s well worth a look. There&#8217;s also a lot more resources about things like 6.6. There&#8217;s the Field Guide that comes out with every single release and that links to all the different documentation about items in that release. If you&#8217;re a developer, it is the place that you need to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />If you&#8217;re an end user, it&#8217;s a great way to learn and if you want to just start contributing to WordPress, it&#8217;s a wonderful place to actually learn how WordPress works and be part of that solution too. So for 6.6, there were 299 core track tickets and 108 of these were enhancements and feature requests. That&#8217;s quite a significant number. There were 16 tickets focused on performance, 24 on accessibility and 15 on modernizing code and applying coding standards. This is what it takes to go into a release. These tickets are from people all over the world, people who have contributed with different skill sets. We&#8217;re now looking at volunteers for 6.7. Again, we&#8217;ll put the link in the show notes if you think actually maybe I can get involved too. Like all three of the people who are on this podcast today, we&#8217;ve all shadowed, we&#8217;ve all been involved with testing and got involved in different aspects of a release. You need to only get involved in a way that has to suit you. You do not have to take on things that you&#8217;re not happy with or take up a commitment that you don&#8217;t feel that you could do at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />The way I got involved was sometime in 2018 or 19, I just started keeping my desktop Slack app open and I would look at it occasionally, like just with my left eye. And gradually I started seeing something that I felt like I could comment on or ask a question about, and so I did. And look at us three, now look at us four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />There are lots of ways as Mary said to get involved. And for anybody who&#8217;s not sure how, we do love all of your messages after shows have been out and I know people have said about what are these notifications, what are these Slack channels? We will try to continue putting those links to that, not just in the Show Notes, but also we try to contribute in other slacks in the Make WordPress community. And also if your local community is wanting to do something and you&#8217;re not sure how, get in touch and we&#8217;ll try and help. And more importantly, we want to try and boost the voices of different communities that don&#8217;t always get airtime. So if you feel that yours hasn&#8217;t and you&#8217;re doing something exciting with a release or something exciting in WooCommerce, do let me know and I can be contacted through Do The Woo, on the Make WordPress Slack, or on Twitter on NonStopNewsUK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />I&#8217;m going to jump back to 6.6 again because there are still a lot of features we want to tell you about. So I&#8217;m going to jump over to Meher. In terms of this particular release, we&#8217;ve looked at pattern management and one of the things that I thought was really good was that 6.6 makes it easier for users with classic themes now to manage the patterns on their site. I know you feel very strongly about WordPress keeping and allowing people who have older versions, to a degree, to still use it and to be able to advance and improve and update, but in a way that they feel supported. Do you think that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going? Do you think that changes, like the ones in pattern management and classic themes, are going to help people to move over to things like the block editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Yes. Having patterns support classic themes will encourage the people who are using classic themes to slowly and steadily think and migrate to full side editing, and make them a bit confident that what they do in classic editor, they will be able to do equally or more better with full side editing. So it is the hope giving to classic editor people that they will gradually with time move to full site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And I think having that pathway is actually really helpful. So if you&#8217;ve not tried Block Editor yet either in your WordPress or your WooCommerce environment, have a look at some of the update and it is, as Meher has really well explained, an easier route and will give you more confidence. The other thing that is also I know very close to Mary&#8217;s heart is this idea that you can mix and match styles now and colors and typography in WordPress 6.6. So before I just go to Mary on that, I&#8217;m going to give a shout out to the developer blog. So Justin Tadlock has done a wonderful feature on the blog which came out a few days ago, all about how to do this. It&#8217;s a great tutorial. I&#8217;ve been through it from both the editorial team but also trying it as a WordPress user and I&#8217;ve had great fun registering color variations and following Justin&#8217;s example of creating an emerald color palette. So that is the Developer Blog and it&#8217;s Developer. WordPress.org. And I&#8217;m going to just go over to Mary so she can tell you a little bit about why all these things and all these new typography and styles and colors make WordPress such a better tool to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />I am a certifiable typography addict from the age of 14 &#8211; which is 50 years for me &#8211; and it has never been easier to use really quality typefaces. Google fonts, yes, and there are a lot of great typefaces on Google fonts. But there are also great typefaces on Adobe type and if you have any sort of creative cloud subscription, you have everything available to you on Adobe type and that&#8217;s slightly complex. But then there&#8217;s a new Monotype subscription where for various not horribly expensive amounts of a year, you can actually download font files that you can then upload to the font folder right in the font management interface in the block editor and has almost anything you want. I mean from major foundries like Monotype and Linotype, places that have been around for a hundred years. But also current contemporary foundries like Latino type and new places like set sales studios and any little type stand you want to follow from the current serif fonts with ligatures and loopy roundy type or brutalist or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Just amazing. Those are now available in your WordPress site and you do not have the write one line of code that in queue a style, but you don&#8217;t even have to do that anymore. Furthermore, your admin clients and those people we call site builders who buy fonts, install it and buy plugins and install it, install them. Those people in the block editor now also can control the type and you can control colors and list any type you want in theme JSON. There&#8217;s a whole new world out there and frankly I should be in a 12 step program about all of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />It is a very exciting time in WordPress, isn&#8217;t it? And if you&#8217;ve never discovered it, this is the time to come and have a look at it and see how it can support your WooCommerce journey too. So also in this release, we have some lots of things on API. So do check out the Field Guide and the links will be in the Show Notes about that. Also, just a reminder that support for PHP 7.0 and 7.1 is dropped in WordPress 6.6. So the minimum supportive version of PHP from WordPress 6.6 is 7.2 0.24, but the recommended version of PHP for WordPress 6.6 remains at 7.4 or greater. So do check the backend of your website, see what PHP you&#8217;re running, if it&#8217;s controlled by your host, have a look if they can upgrade it for you. And it just as Mary&#8217;s talked about, it helps to make a more efficient and secure web as well. So I&#8217;m going to go back to Meher. In this release, as in all releases, we have improvements in internationalization and we also have lots of polyglots that are involved after every release. What do these volunteer translators have to do with a release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />The volunteer translators help the release by translating the new version of WordPress into different languages because the 45%, 46% of the web which uses WordPress doesn&#8217;t always use English as a default language. There are many websites out there which uses WordPress in its own language. For example in French, in Hindi, in Spanish, in different languages. So when the release is published, the same English words have to be transmitted is multiple languages. So these translators volunteers help to translate and keep the release up to date so that when a non-English website which uses WordPress updates, it doesn&#8217;t break all of a sudden and from Spanish everything goes into English. It just makes sure that whatever language you are using WordPress in has the right language for the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Thank you Meher and a very, very big shout out to all those polyglots who have been working around the clock for many of them to translate the latest release, their work is just amazing and you can get involved with that too. See there&#8217;s so many ways you can get involved and we&#8217;ll put that in the show links. The show links are getting bigger and bigger at this rate, but that&#8217;s as we said earlier is how we like to do things at Do The Woo as we like to be part of your journey and hopefully learn alongside you but also help you navigate the learning process. Talking about learning there is Learn.WordPress.org and people who follow this show know that we love to highlight this and we&#8217;ll be doing something on this and focusing on releases in the summer as well. So do come back and see what we&#8217;re doing on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Just a few quick hits on the release if you haven&#8217;t caught them already. There&#8217;s a new version of React and that&#8217;s available in WordPress 6.6. So do again check out the Field Guide and because this is the place that you will get all the details that you need about it, there is lots of preparation help too for the React 19 upgrade. So if you&#8217;re a dev and you&#8217;re not quite sure this is going to involve make WordPress, core has got it covered. One of the things that we often get asked is how do you get involved with some of these things when you work or you live in different time zones. So just with the two guests that we have on today, they are in completely utterly different time zones. Meher, what time is it for you right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Right now as we record this podcast, it is 1041 PM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Meher and Mary, what time is it for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Quarter past 12pm, just after noon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />For Bob and I on the show at the moment, it is just about quarter past six in the evening. So just this little microcosm shows you that you do not have to be in the same time zone. Some things can be harder when you&#8217;re not, but there is a proposal and it&#8217;s just been published by Joe McGill, the current core team rep about what time should the Dev Chat be for 6.7. We will put a link to that because they do want your views and also if you are not able to join anything like the developer&#8217;s chat or any of the live experiences that exist around a release, then you can contribute async and I&#8217;m going to go to Meher first. Meher, you&#8217;re often in a completely different time zone, I never can keep up with which time zone you&#8217;re actually working in the moment. But if you could share as some of your final thoughts, why is contributing async worth doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />The time for each release good for the Europeans as well as the Americans. It&#8217;s not really good for the Asians but for 6.7 as a lot of folks in the release are from the Asian countries. They&#8217;re trying and see if they can schedule the release parties in a better time zone for Asia. And if you can join those parties, you can come to know how the release cycle goes. If you cannot, you are always most welcome to contribute async. You can test out the release cycle and if you find some major bugs or your test website crashes or it just doesn&#8217;t load, you can always create a Trac ticket or leave it on the code channel. What exactly happened when you updated something and someone will definitely help you when it is a good time in the European American side, one of the reasons I encourage people to participate, whether async or at the given time the release is because you are helping the release be better when it is officially released. A lot of people say that there is a bug when a release happens, but if you want to help solve the bugs, come be a part the release cycle and let&#8217;s avoid that. Let&#8217;s try and see if we can avoid that as possible and make WordPress better than we did because that&#8217;s how we grow in the entire world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />I love that answer Meher, thank you very much. I think that&#8217;s just perfect and as Meher said, it really is important. So Mary, you&#8217;ve worked in the US predominantly and worked normally in the US’s different time zones. What has it been like to actually work globally in the way that you have in core in other teams as well , and what do you think makes it special about WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />One thing, it&#8217;s really efficient. I can draft a post, like a release post or a thing about coordination or a proposal in my evening and tell people it&#8217;s there on Slack and wake up to feedback when I work on the Dev Blog. Same thing in my afternoon and evening. People are often asleep, they wake up when I&#8217;m asleep, when I wake up, things have moved forward. That&#8217;s pretty nice and I know that it&#8217;s one thing that we think of across the project is essentially it&#8217;s a way to cover questions. Certainly on the support forums, it&#8217;s a way to get questions answered from users 24 -7 because everybody has different holidays, everybody has different days of the week that they&#8217;re unavailable. I mean even the concept of a weekend is different. There are people who are definitely off on Sundays and definitely off on Saturdays and definitely off on Fridays. And that means there are also people who start their week on Sunday and people who start their week on Monday. I&#8217;m not sure of anybody who starts their week on Tuesday, well me occasionally, and people who work at country clubs in the US, but it means that there&#8217;s always something happening and things are moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />Absolutely. It&#8217;s the idea that there is constantly something that you can get involved with and moving forward. And if you&#8217;ve not had a go yet, give it a go. You can join people all over the world and you can definitely do that here with us at the WordPress way. Thank you for joining us today for this and I hope you&#8217;ve found out some more about 6.6. Hope it&#8217;s made you really want to go and try it. We&#8217;re already working on 6.7 and what we&#8217;re going to be doing for Do The Woo. So as usual, please send us your items for what you&#8217;d like to see highlighted, how you would like to get involved, that you&#8217;ll want to know more about. And the joy we&#8217;ve had at Do the Woo is putting people in touch with the various groups, the squad that they need to talk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />And it&#8217;s been a real joy when we&#8217;ve had that, particularly from the areas where they haven&#8217;t had contributors before. So please keep doing that. We are here to support you from Do The Woo. All that remains for me, is really is to thank our two guests, Mary Baum and Meher as well. And it&#8217;s just been wonderful to be sitting here talking to you about 6.6. I want to do a shout out to everyone who helped prepare for this as well today and who sent in suggestions and information and of course to Bob who really is an energetic enthusiast for us getting those voices that we don&#8217;t always hear and for spreading that international message. So thank you for joining us. Do come and check out 6.7 when it lands later next year, get involved with the 6.7 team and we&#8217;ll have all those links on the show notes. But for now, it&#8217;s goodbye from me and I&#8217;ll let our guests say their farewells too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary:<br />Well, thank you very much Abha and Bob and Meher, and we&#8217;ll catch you on the flip side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher:<br />Thank you to Abha, thank you to Bob for having us. Thank you to Mary for being with me in this podcast. To all the great publishers out there, go try out 6.6, come be a partner of 6.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abha:<br />And if you are new and have just discovered these releases, and you actually get involved from what we&#8217;ve been trying to put out there, then let us know. We always want to feature things like that and to help encourage. So catch you next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong>, host <strong>Abha Thakor</strong> is joined by <strong>Mary Baum and Meher Bala</strong>, as they chat about the recently released WordPress 6.6. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore various aspects of the release, including the challenges and rewards of being involved in the development process.

I include myself in that group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with each iteration of the community, personally, I always feel like it&#8217;s something that is not only a good idea for us to think about but also a healthy way to broaden our thoughts and opinions. For some people, it&#8217;s a bit scary to do this because they find the bubble a comfort zone. Others are much more comfortable. And even more so, some step outside of it for good, which is often the best decision for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it mean to step outside the bubble? Well, it&#8217;s what you make it. Learning something new. Joining conversations that give you a more open mind. Or perhaps attending an event or conference that allows you to expand your scope on how you do business and who you do it with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things to ponder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest traps in our space is our Slack channels, which are one of two things: an echo chamber or a place with like-minded people who follow a single path. Now, I am not saying don&#8217;t participate in these. Instead, I suggest you find additional avenues of conversation that are not just in compliance with how you feel or think about something in the community. Reaffirmation is helpful, but it can also get you stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that all said, let me share how we, as a community at Do the Woo, are trying to help you step outside the bubble with two shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Talk on Open Source. This is one of our newer shows that I have talked about a bit in the past. It is hosted by Robert Jacobi and Courtney Robertson, both avid open source proponents. The idea for the show was inside my head since last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What inspired me to pull it together was not only had I heard others talking about the need for this, but it also nagged at me. The fact that so many of us in the WordPress ecosystem love open source for the obvious reason but are not exposed to all the amazing projects around us that bring open source to the surface and also integrate or work alongside WordPress itself. As a result, this show is perfect for anyone who loves WordPress as an open-source project and wants to discover those projects outside our space and what they mean to you and the growth of open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we also have our new show about Scaling Enterprise. Working with the Scale Consortium, this show has also been in the works for quite some time and is now out in the wild with hosts Brad Williams, Karim Marucchi, and Tom Willmot. What makes this show unique is it&#8217;s broken up into two separate shows, The Buyer&#8217;s View and The Inside Track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inside Track, which premiered yesterday, is more focused on WordPress in Enterprise. On the other hand, The Buyer&#8217;s View gives us a look at open source software beyond WordPress when it comes to enterprise. So essentially, you get the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two shows are examples of how we want to help you explore technology beyond the WordPress bubble. And I&#8217;m sure even within our other existing shows, you will find bits and pieces of it as well. Plus, I imagine you may find more about it on our new blog that is just around the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I would like to share my own experience that lends itself to events outside of WordPress. This last March, I attended CloudFest in Germany for the first time. It started with the Hackathon that led into the event. And yes, there was also a WordPress day. Something I believe you are going to see grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people came only for that day, and I am hoping next March that they decide to stick around for the entire event. Now it is focused on technology in the cloud, so not everything may be of interest. But I can guarantee you that you will meet some amazing people with all sorts of talents and views that will make it worth the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Myself, I used to go to these conferences in my other pre-WordPress life. And I was so happy that I stepped out of the bubble of WordCamps and experienced CloudFest. In fact, I was so impressed, chances are good I will be going again next March. So hope to see you there and if you have any questions about it, ping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that is that. And as I said at the beginning, find your own paths to explore the tech communities outside of WordPress no matter what you do professionally in our space. Take some breaks from those Slack channels and reflect on the bigger picture. Give yourself some time to reevaluate how this may just make you happier and more flexible with your own ideas and thoughts. I have done this recently myself in a lot of different ways aside from what I have already mentioned around the podcast and events. Maybe that is something for another time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of WordCamps, if you are going to WordCamp US, let&#8217;s connect or reconnect. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing everyone and know that having a balance of inside and outside the bubble is nothing better than a happier frame of mind. So until the next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>BobWP on Community, BobWP</strong> talks about the importance of stepping outside the WordPress bubble to broaden our thoughts and opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key takeaways from the transcript are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Stepping Outside the Bubble</strong>: It&#8217;s beneficial to explore beyond the WordPress community to gain new perspectives, learn, and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning and Broadening Horizons</strong>: Engaging in new activities, joining diverse conversations, and attending different events can help broaden your scope and improve how you do business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avoiding Echo Chambers</strong>: Participating in diverse conversations and exploring different avenues can prevent getting stuck in an echo chamber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Initiatives at Do the Woo</strong>: The community is encouraged to step outside the WordPress bubble through new shows like &#8220;Open Talk on Open Source&#8221; and &#8220;Scaling Enterprise,&#8221; which highlight technology beyond WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Value of Events Outside WordPress</strong>: Attending events like CloudFest offers opportunities to meet diverse people and gain insights beyond the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: Exploring outside familiar zones can lead to personal and professional growth, making one happier and more flexible in their ideas and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/podcasts/open-talk-on-open-source/\">Open Talk on Open Source</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/podcasts/scaling-enterprise-wordpress-and-open-source-software/\">Scaling Enterprise, WordPress &amp; OSS</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cloudfest.com/\">CloudFest 2025</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Aug 2024 08:56:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: #131 – Abraham Waita on Nurturing Young WordPress Enthusiasts in Uganda\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=158288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/131-abraham-waita-on-nurturing-young-wordpress-enthusiasts-in-uganda\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27109:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the jukebox podcast from WP Tavern.

He&#8217;s recently given a talk at WordCamp Europe, which we discuss in this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abraham has been instrumental in rolling out WordPress to high schools in Uganda. Fostering a rapidly growing young WordPress community. His talk entitled, Diverse and Sustainable Future: How High School Teachers in Uganda are Nurturing a Young WordPress Community, shines a light on this initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the dynamics of the WordPress community in Uganda, it&#8217;s impressive growth and the challenges it has faced along the way. Abraham provides insights into how WordPress is being taught in high school, through the ICT curriculum, and the creative project students have undertaken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also discusses the importance of community support, including sponsorships and hardware donations, and how these contributions can immensely benefit the educational enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of our conversation, we get into the broader impact of this initiative on students&#8217; futures, and how companies, or individuals, can sponsor this endeavor.

Hi Abraham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:05] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Hey Nathan. I&#8217;ve just come from my talk and I&#8217;m feeling the nervousness is dying down, so I&#8217;m finally enjoying WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you just done it just now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> A few hours ago, but the emotions leading to the talk were so high, so right now I&#8217;m just letting everything go like down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m very impressed of anybody that can do a talk at an event like this because it must be very nerve wracking. And until it&#8217;s over, I guess you&#8217;re carrying it around until it&#8217;s actually finished. So well done, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is actually the topic of the conversation today. We&#8217;re going to talk about the subject that you talked about on stage. But before we get into that, could you just introduce yourself. Maybe, I don&#8217;t know, a minute, thirty seconds. Just tell us who you are, where you live, who you work for, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah, so, Abraham, I&#8217;m based in Nairobi, Kenya, but I&#8217;m actually active in two WordPress communities. That&#8217;s the WordPress community in Kenya, and the one in Uganda. And the funny fact is that I attend more WordCamps in Uganda than in Kenya. That&#8217;s why I am associated with the community in Uganda more than the one in Kenya. I work at Automattic as a Woo Happiness Engineer, so I&#8217;m usually supporting people using WooCommerce, specifically with, I help with payment issues and, outside that is when I go to do community work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the talk that you did was entitled as follows, Diverse and sustainable future: How high school teachers in Uganda are nurturing a young WordPress community. And when I saw that title, I thought, well, I really want to know a little bit more about that. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got you in to talk about today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you just tell us a little bit about the community, the WordPress community in Uganda? Is it growing? Is it shrinking? Is it large? Is it small? The only point of reference that I&#8217;ve got is WordPress. I confess, I&#8217;ve never been to Uganda, I don&#8217;t know anything about it. I&#8217;m imagining quite a few of the people listening have also not been to Uganda. But I&#8217;d be just interested to hear, just tell us what it&#8217;s like over there for the WordPressers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah. The community&#8217;s growing at a very high rate right now because we are rolling out WordPress to all high schools in Uganda, and all high schools combined have 1.4 million students. So as we introduce more of them to WordPress, the community keeps growing, and that&#8217;s one of the things we are having, is the surging numbers in attendees who want to come to WordCamps. Because the venues are now limited such that we have to introduce some sort of limitations to who can come. And as we look for bigger venues, the community&#8217;s growing very rapidly right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting because that stands in stark contrast to where I am, which is the UK. When Covid came along, that kind of really did shutter the WordPress community down, and the events have not come back yet. But you have a very different experience in Uganda, so that&#8217;s really nice to hear. It&#8217;s growing, and in fact, at events, you&#8217;re turning people away because there&#8217;s not enough space in the venues. That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it just WordPress, or is it open source in general? So for example, would I find, I don&#8217;t know if you know, but would I find a growing Drupal community as well, or is it uniquely WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:08] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> It&#8217;s mostly WordPress because it&#8217;s the tool that&#8217;s being broadcasted in high schools, like being spread out in high schools. So that&#8217;s the main focus for now. As we try to move into more schools with WordPress, we are getting more of that development in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe other CMSs will also grow as a result of people looking for alternatives, but for now it&#8217;s mostly WordPress that&#8217;s growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In the part of the world where I live, if children were to encounter WordPress, it would probably be because of a parent. As far as I&#8217;m aware, and forgive me if I&#8217;ve got this wrong, there&#8217;s no school program. I mean, maybe some ingenious teacher is offering a club after school, but as far as I&#8217;m aware, there&#8217;s no state sponsored, government led WordPress training. Is that what&#8217;s happening in Uganda? Is it officially inside the school time, it&#8217;s being taught as an actual lesson, or is it more end of the day club kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> It&#8217;s taught in a subject called ICT, and it was open-ended for teachers to interpret how they would like to teach it, because the curriculum just said, we need your students to be able to come up with a project that solves problems in their communities. So initially how they were teaching that subject, the ICT subject, was with tools that could not meet this requirement. And so they ended up turning to WordPress, and that&#8217;s how, right now, you&#8217;ll find, yes, students are in a computer lab learning WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Got it. Okay, so it&#8217;s entirely up to the individual teacher how far they want to go with that. And they could ignore WordPress altogether, but it&#8217;s allowed, and many people are doing it. Why have they chosen WordPress in particular? Is it just because there is a community, and there&#8217;s understanding, broadly, of how it works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> So, the biggest contributor was the, number one, it&#8217;s open source, and then the community involvement. So it&#8217;s now, let&#8217;s say, that there&#8217;s already a community around WordPress. There are WordCamps, there are meetup groups, so they&#8217;re not really starting from scratch if they want to spread it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those are some of the preexisting conditions that have made WordPress to grow quickly because you have sponsored WordCamps, you have preexisting meetup groups, and it&#8217;s from there that other things have come up. So we have moved from two active meetup groups to six, and most of the new ones are teacher led. They are using the meetup spaces to share knowledge to each other. And from the knowledge sharing, now the teachers move back to students, and the students get to benefit from what the teachers have learned. So it&#8217;s like a, not a food chain of knowledge, but yeah, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I understand. Yeah, so it&#8217;s kind of top down. It&#8217;s trickling down, yeah. And what kind of things are being taught? Because there&#8217;s just literally millions of things that you could teach people about WordPress. But, are you starting at the basics? Like how to install WordPress, here&#8217;s how to create a page. And just tell us what these curricular might look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:06] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Sure. So the initial point is usually getting WordPress installed, and due to internet challenges, it&#8217;s usually on local hosts and using XAMP. And once the students know how to install WordPress on local host, they are now introduced to building pages, posts, and then lastly plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s from the plugins where the teachers now start stepping backwards, and they allow students to explore. So we have seen students who have come up with crazy projects because they went above and beyond in the exploration journey. So like, one of the projects, I ask the students, so how did you build this platform? You say, it allows students to filter the schools. And he was like, oh, I have plugins for this, and here I set up custom post types, I am using ACF something. And I was impressed because the teacher did not teach him that. He just went exploring, and from there, he got to know more than, let&#8217;s say, the teacher, and come up with huge projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of guided learning, but then also you are seeing the children are just taking it off in any direction. I mean, I guess if you teach any subject, a proportion of children will be disinterested, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s the case with WordPress. But there&#8217;s always going to be those who just hook into it and think, this is the best thing ever, and go off and explore and, as you said, start making things like custom post types, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel that, in the last few years, the way WordPress has gone since the advent of Gutenberg, the block editor, it&#8217;s made it much more powerful for a vanilla, non plugin WordPress, so just a vanilla install of WordPress. To get yourself something credible just with the block editor. So I imagine there&#8217;s a lot of experimentation with blocks and things like that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:51] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah, actually one of the WordCamps I attended, the first session was covering blocks, and using Gutenberg to develop a functional site. And it&#8217;s from there that it&#8217;s like an entry point for beginners. Those are the learning points, what you can do with just a basic installation of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, got it. Just to recap a little bit, you&#8217;ve got the meetups and there&#8217;s, now it&#8217;s gone from two to six, and at those you&#8217;ve got a lot of teachers attending as attendees to that event. And then they&#8217;re learning, and then they&#8217;re going back to their schools, and then they&#8217;re doing all these things. So it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s one curricular, there&#8217;s just multiple different ways that it&#8217;s being taught.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:32] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah. So it&#8217;s a total of about six sustainable initiatives, that the teachers are using to spread WordPress quickly, as quickly as possible to all schools, to teachers and to students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you need more support in this endeavor? Is it growing at the point where you need to reach out and, I don&#8217;t know, maybe make it eight meet ups or twelve meet ups? And also, the finance of all of that because, although there&#8217;s a lot of voluntary time in, you know, you still have to do things like pay for the venue possibly, and things like that. Would you welcome some more support?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine that there&#8217;ll be people listening into this podcast who maybe work for a company that&#8217;s got an initiative, that they may wish to contact you and discuss things. So are you looking for support, financial or otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:11] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Sure. We really are looking for all possible support. So mostly, if there are, let&#8217;s say more sponsors currently, the sponsors that are available, we really appreciate them, but we still require more assistance. So there are some areas we could really grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one is getting bigger venues. So, as I said, we now have to limit to around 200 students, but what if now we could allow a thousand students from different schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing, we have competitions going on, and a rewarding factor for participating in a competition is you get a present or something. So in the past, I would like to give maybe a shout out to two companies who have given some presents in the past. We have Yoast, who gave a free SEO training to winners of one competition. Alongside wordpress.com, who had some swag for them as well. It&#8217;s also a motivating factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, yeah, there&#8217;s something else called a sponsor in kind in Uganda. So it goes all the way from, like last time someone gave a router, a 4G router to give internet to the production team, to the attendees, so that there&#8217;s wifi. And that&#8217;s as little as it can be like, from just being an enabler of the basic services to, let&#8217;s say, being a sponsor at a given level. And, yeah, your funds will really go a long way in that event. Maybe lunch for the attendees, something else like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So before we end this podcast, I&#8217;ll make absolutely sure that we&#8217;ve got any links to any pages that you may wish to point people towards. But we&#8217;ll also make sure that your contact details are there, and i&#8217;m imagine that you&#8217;ll be happy to receive emails about this subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned about motivating factors. Is that an important part of it? When these children are turning up to learn, are they seeing it just, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a bit of fun, I can build a website, or is there more to it? Like, okay, this could be a job for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a certain sense of it carrying through after school. I don&#8217;t know if you track that, or if it&#8217;s been going for long enough to see that, look what we did, we&#8217;ve now got, I don&#8217;t know, 100, 200, 300 people who are building websites for clients all over the world. Is it carrying on after school? Is it, sustainable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:23] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Okay, so for carrying on, we are looking forward to the end of this year because that&#8217;s when the first cohort under the new curriculum will be examined. So when they go out, it&#8217;s the first group we will have coming out of high school with WordPress education. And then it&#8217;s, from there we can see whether they are taking it outside school. But from now, for the time being, yes, we have seen them taking some projects. So we have students who have built websites for their schools, where the schools didn&#8217;t have any websites, and now they have websites because the students learn how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it is carrying on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Definitely carrying on, but I guess only time will tell how that goes. But if you&#8217;re pushing a lot of children through the project, I&#8217;m sure that, in the end, it will have that effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does the actual lesson look? I think you mentioned something like a computer lab, or something like that. Again, I&#8217;ve no idea what schools are equipped with in Uganda. So, is it a bit like a classroom environment, where there&#8217;s computers around the wall and you just begin, and you carry on from where you left last time? Or is it, everybody sit down, look at the whiteboard at the front, or the blackboard or whatever it may be, and I&#8217;m going to teach you this thing, and then you&#8217;ve got to go over and experiment with that? What does the actual lesson look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:31] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> As a requirement for the ICT, the schools are offering ICT, they require computer labs. So it&#8217;s up to them to know how to, let&#8217;s say, schedule the classes into smaller groups to fit the number of computers they have, so that each student can attend like practically a lesson. But during WordCamps, you&#8217;ll find most students don&#8217;t have laptops. So during WordCamps, we just have a projector screen, and if it&#8217;s a tutorial, we are taking them through, one student will actually be doing the practical bit of it. But the learning part, we use computer lab, mostly computer labs in their schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s difficult to sort of say, but where I come from in the UK, there&#8217;s a lot of laptops lying around. There&#8217;s many, many, laptops. I&#8217;m sure that quite a few of the children have got laptops, that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you welcome anything like that? You know, do you need more actual hardware? You mentioned things like routers, and financial contributions and things. Anybody listening to this who might happen to have some of that stuff lying around, is that something you would welcome, or you&#8217;ve got to use certain things, and buy them through government channels, or what have you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:35] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah, that would be really welcomed because one of the challenges is that there are schools who really can&#8217;t teach WordPress because they don&#8217;t have the basic requirement of a computer lab, because they don&#8217;t have laptops, they don&#8217;t have computers, they don&#8217;t have anything to teach this subject. So they are limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the students in those schools unfortunately can&#8217;t benefit like the others. If there&#8217;s hardware support, computers, laptops, anything that can load WordPress installation, because it&#8217;ll be localised, it&#8217;s minimal resources. Anything like that could really go a long way in such schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you played with Playground?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Personally, not yet, but I would say it&#8217;s now a great thing, to have a quick installation of WordPress on the site. Although, in Uganda, for now it may be a challenge, because you need continuous connection, which the students may not have. That&#8217;s why, for now, they are still on XAMP and local host installations, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yes, that will be the future because the connectivity is coming and, yeah, we will have more opportunities to introduce students also to that. I also look forward to playing around with Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s an amazing technology, and it feels that any part of the world, Uganda or anywhere else, it would be just such a superb tool for the classroom because you click a button, and four seconds, five seconds later, you have a WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a few little caveats around that. There&#8217;s a few things that you can&#8217;t do, but broadly speaking, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, when you close the browser, it goes away. But in the near future, one of the developers in the project, I think there are three of them now, they&#8217;re going to make it persistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you close the browser, and then sometime later open the browser, and it will still be there. But of course, I guess one of the things with that is that then it&#8217;s still stuck on your computer, which is fine if you possess a computer, but if you go home and the computer was at school, you then can&#8217;t use it. But maybe in the future it will be able to be exported somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:32] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does the sort of hosting aspect go? Because you mentioned that a child had built school website. Did school pay for the hosting of that? How did it all of that happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:41] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> So there&#8217;s a lot of voluntary efforts going on, and some companies offer free hosting if possible. Sometimes the schools pay for the hosting. So it&#8217;s a mix. Sometimes the schools will pay, sometimes a volunteer will just support them by hosting. So that&#8217;s one of the hosts supporting, or sponsoring in kind initiatives I was mentioning. You don&#8217;t have to give, let&#8217;s say, a financial contribution, but hosting a site is one of the contribution ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I mean, it all sounds absolutely amazing. It&#8217;s lovely to see a part of the world where WordPress is growing so rapidly. And I guess, you know, it&#8217;s from the endeavors of people like you that it&#8217;s all happening. So thank you for all of your hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you mention any websites, or places we could go, organisations that we could find out about, that would enable us to find out more, but also maybe, I don&#8217;t know, send some sort of sponsorship, or donation, or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:35] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> You can, first of all, to reach out to the organisers of the different WordCamps, if you&#8217;d like to sponsor a WordCamp. You can go to central.wordcamp.org, and then you&#8217;ll find a listing of the upcoming WordCamps. And you&#8217;ll find, let&#8217;s say, in July, there&#8217;s a Uganda Websites competition. If you click on it, you can now find your way to the sponsor&#8217;s page, and sponsor directly from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to connect with the teachers association that has been behind all the efforts of all these outreach program in spreading WordPress to schools, you can first reach out to them on Twitter. They are @ICTTeachersUG, and their site is ictteachersug.net. And lastly, if you&#8217;d like me to connect you with, because there are so many other people involved, if you&#8217;d like me to connect you with, let&#8217;s say, whoever is leading the next meetup, or the next WordCamp, you can find me on LinkedIn as Abraham Waita, and I&#8217;ll be happy to link you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will make sure that all of those links go into the show notes. So if you go to wptavern.com/podcast, you&#8217;ll be able to find the episode there, and you can click on the links and hopefully connect with Abraham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for chatting to me today. What an impressive community you&#8217;ve got over there. I hope it continues, and I hope you manage to teach more children as the days, and weeks, and months go by, all about the virtues of WordPress. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:58] <strong>Abraham Waita:</strong> Thank you Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-waita/\">Abraham Waita</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abraham is a Woo Happiness Engineer at Automattic and is very active in the WordPress communities of both Kenya and Uganda. He’s recently given a talk at WordCamp Europe, which we discuss in this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abraham has been instrumental in rolling out WordPress to high schools in Uganda, fostering a rapidly growing young WordPress community. His talk, entitled &#8220;Diverse and Sustainable Future: How High School Teachers in Uganda are Nurturing a Young WordPress Community,&#8221; shines a light on this initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the dynamics of the WordPress community in Uganda, its impressive growth, and the challenges it has faced along the way. Abraham provides insights into how WordPress is being taught in high schools through the ICT curriculum and the creative projects students have undertaken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also discusses the importance of community support, including sponsorships and hardware donations, and how these contributions can immensely benefit the educational enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of our conversation, we get into the broader impact of this initiative on students&#8217; futures, and how companies or individuals can support this endeavour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re passionate about education, WordPress, or community growth, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp&#8217;s in Uganda 2024: <a href=\"https://lira.wordcamp.org/2024/\">Lira</a> and <a href=\"https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2024/\">Jinja</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp&#8217;s in Kenya 2024: <a href=\"https://nairobi.wordcamp.org/2024/\">Nairobi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html\">XAMP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">ACF</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ICTTeachersUG\">ICT Teachers Association of Uganda (ITAU)</a> on X</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictteachersug.net/\">ICT Teachers&#8217; Association of Uganda [ITAU]</a> website</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-waita/\">Abraham on LinkedIn</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"Do The Woo Community: Insights from the 2023 State of Enterprise WordPress Survey with Mario Peshev\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85063\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://dothewoo.io/insights-from-the-2023-state-of-enterprise-wordpress-survey-with-mario-peshev/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47385:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-31 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-30 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-29 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-13 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-28 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1650\" height=\"1650\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/avalara-logo-_dtw.png?resize=1650%2C1650&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-75400\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-14\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/enterprise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Avalara</a></strong>:  providing cloud-based and scalable global tax compliance that is hassle-free, safe and secure plus topped off with enterprise-class security.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nEpisode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Brad:<br />Hey everybody. Welcome to another episode of the Enterprise WordPress Podcast, Scaling Enterprise. This is The Inside Track edition of the podcast, which I&#8217;m very excited to dig into. So on this show, we&#8217;re really digging into enterprise WordPress, of course, but really within the community, within WordPress, what&#8217;s happening, what&#8217;s going on with Enterprise? Who&#8217;s launching cool sites, what kind of crazy functionality or examples within the enterprise have we seen to really kind of validate what WordPress can do at scale within these large organizations? So I&#8217;m really excited to dig into a new show. So I have brought on a couple of my friends, good friends on the show. So let&#8217;s meet them and then we&#8217;ll dive right into it. First up, we got Mr. Tom over there at Human Made. Tom, why don’t you tell everybody who you are and what you do, especially around the enterprise side of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Sure. Well, if folks listen to the episode we put out a couple of weeks ago, which was with Karim, you might remember me from that. If not, plug, go and listen to it. It was a great episode. I’m the co-founder and CEO of Human Made. Also, one of the founding members of Scale Consortium. Been doing Enterprise WordPress for coming on 15 years or so. So got plenty of scars and stories to tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Lots of stories to tell. We can’t wait to get into some of those stories, the ones you’re allowed to share outside those NDAs. Right. And next up, of course, we have Mario. Mario, why don’t you introduce yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Hey everyone. First off, pleased to be here. Great crowd. I’ve known you guys for over a decade now, maybe close to 15 years. My name is Mario Peshev. I run several different companies. One of them is DevriX, it’s a WordPress Boutique Agency, profiling in small and medium enterprises. Even though we work with some Fortune one thousands, we used to work with Meta, automotive companies, banks, telecom. So Enterprise is very dear to my heart. If it wasn’t for Enterprise, I wouldn’t have discovered WordPress. Well, and I wouldn’t have stuck long enough in WordPress if it wasn’t for Enterprise either. So that’s definitely something I love talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. And I’m especially excited because not only do we know each other, we all run our own agencies. We’ve been doing this for, well longer than 10 years, over a decade. But I also think it’s interesting because of just our locations within the world and especially kind of bringing not only experiences within WordPress online but also where we live. So I’m in Philadelphia. I’m on the east coast in the United States. Tom, where are you at?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I am in France. So currently enjoying the Olympics originally from the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Are you at the Olympics?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, I want to say I’m at the Olympics right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Are you living in France now? I didn’t even realize you moved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I do live in France. Yeah, I’ve lived here for a couple of years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />You are a big Olympics fan if you moved there two years ahead just to get ready for it. That’s cool. Mario, you’re a little bit further over there, right? Where are you at?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Not too far off from Tom right now I’m in Bulgaria, which is just one time zone ahead, but we used to be a little further apart when you used to live in the UK, right, Tom?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Exactly. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />A little closer. But yeah, I think it’s just having not only a perspective, like I said, of what we do online because it’s amazing that we can connect this. I’m still blown away by technology and that we can just kind of get together and chat about things. So it’s got to be a lot of fun. I think we’re going to have different perspectives as well with our clients and just our experiences. So let’s jump in. I know we’ve got a lot of big topics you want to kind of dive into and talk about. The first one that I really, I like to ask people this and people ask me this a lot too, but I think it’s a fun question. It’s really just defining enterprise specifically within the WordPress world, right? It’s such a big, it’s just a heavy word, right? Enterprise. What does that mean? I’d love to hear, I think each one of us maybe take a turn and just kind of in our own words, when someone says enterprise or enterprise WordPress, what does that mean to you? How do you describe WordPress within the enterprise? And Tom, you want to kick us off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Sure. I mean, probably in its simplest form inside the WordPress space, usually it just means big stuff, right? Big projects or big companies or something. Probably that’s how we all first came across it. WordPress is starting to be used for more serious stuff. I think also you can think in the broader software world, enterprise often just means customized, not going to take it off the shelf. You go on the pricing page, it says a hundred bucks a month, 200 bucks a month contact us. Enterprise is the contact us option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />It’s the no price listed option, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />No price listed option. There’s no off the shelf plan for you. You need to customize it. And so you need to work with, often you need to work with one of our service providers to do that. I think in the enterprise CMS space, you can often think of the difference as being enterprises need a platform. They don’t really think of it as we want a website and what’s the CMS? We need a website. They think we need a platform to power all our websites to power all the stuff we’re doing to integrate with all the stuff we are using to fit with all of our workflows, hence the need for it to be heavily customized. So I guess, yeah, probably that’s how I’d think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah. Mario, let’s see your take and I’ll give you mine and we’ll see if we’re all thinking the same way, if we’re laying a little different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Yeah, I love the definition of enterprise being the cost plan. It’s always custom. You always talk to an enterprise sales rep. You always have a custom quote, an RFP, and presentations, index, and stuff. And the reason you do that is you’re talking to 12 different stakeholders. You have to escalate to the board and get approved from the CFO and it’s just slow to this process. If we have to get super literal, once again enterprises, it comes from Latin and then it goes to French. And I don’t speak French, so Tom can correct me, but it comes from, what is it, entrepreneur or so, which is like to undertake or however it’s translated. Tom, do you know the actual definition? You’ve been living there for two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I don’t know the old French definition of enterprise unfortunately, but I’ll do my research for the next show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />There we go. But yeah, I mean essentially it is just to undertake and we are all entrepreneurs, right? Because we start new businesses, we undertake actions. So semantically speaking, even one person company is an enterprise. Realistically speaking, we have micro-enterprises up to 10 people or a certain revenue cap. Then we have small enterprises up to 50 people, small-medium enterprises up to 250, and then they just keep scaling up in the grand scheme of things. Looking at the top of the chart, I always take a look at like s and p 500 or NASDAQ companies. Most of the FAANG companies, they do have hundreds of thousands of employees. Amazon I believe is probably the largest out of the tech at least. They used to pick at about 1.5 million staff members and now they’re at 1.3, 1.4. But we are talking about tens, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of team members, which of course, if you can imagine org chart, it gets to lots of different C levels and VPs and senior VPs and then directors and supervisors and all these kind of trailing down. So the difference between a small startup project and an enterprise, I usually speak to more people. You have to take more decisions, you have to deal with data privacy, security, scalability, and lots of other different considerations that you may not necessarily be dealing with in a small team environment. How about you, Brad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I kind of go back to how Tom simplifies it, like big WordPress, that’s how I’ve always described it. Big WordPress, big challenges, big goals, big needs. When I say big, it may not be that what they might need is necessarily a big lift to build, but when you build something in the enterprise for a big conglomerate or big company, things take a lot more work to do, even simple tasks. So I think big, it’s not always this massively complex customized system. It just means building things in that are going to scale in the enterprise. They’re going to handle the traffic, they’re going to meet all those really strict security requirements, accessibility requirements, all these things that every company out there is important to them. But they need agencies like ours to help them through that, navigate through that, especially when it comes to WordPress. But yeah, I love to hear, I think most people think when you hear enterprise, it’s like Microsoft or it’s just these biggest of the biggest, the whatever, the s and p 100. But it could</p>\n\n\n\n<p>be quite a bit bigger than that. I honestly think, Tom, you guys do a lot of work with universities and stuff. I think a lot of the universities, I consider enterprise because they have big needs and big challenges. They certainly have enterprise needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of content that they’re trying to figure out how to make it in a way that people can find what they need, which is probably one of the biggest challenges for universities and even local government is the sheer size of content they have to have out there and then make it easy to find what you’re looking for. But yeah, that’s how I kind of define it. I think it’s a big term because it should be, but it can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, which we’ll talk about a little bit. The state of enterprise survey that went out, we’ll get into that, but the way it’s defined within the survey, which I thought was pretty good too, is a high profile brand, a publisher with a national and or global audience or a corporate conglomerate. So I think that kind of helps summarize it too, but it’s really big WordPress big needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is enterprise and WordPress so important? Why are we talking about it? Especially when I say we, I mean not just the three of us on the show, but agencies that really help build WordPress at scale within the enterprise. Obviously this is important to us, but why is it important for the larger community within WordPress? Why is enterprise, why are we focused so much on it? Why are we spending so much time? I almost try to help grow WordPress within the enterprise, help corporations realize that it’s a great product that can compete with anything that they’re using, but why is it because the majority of people that use WordPress could care less about the enterprise, right? This is a very small percentage of WordPress builders and users that would be considered in this space. So the big question is why is it important for WordPress that we’re actually talking about the enterprise and trying to get more people to adopt WordPress within the enterprise? I’ll just open it up, whoever wants to jump in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Well, so from where I stand, one of the reasons is the versatility of WordPress as a platform. So when we take a look at different software applications or tools or so, we do have a pretty broad spectrum of a single creator or a solopreneur type of systems and very high scale enterprise solutions out there. And WordPress is one of the very few platforms that is able to serve both at the same time. There are certain, and I’m probably not going to name specific names or so, but just the Indie hacker solopreneur tools that are one personality. They don’t have a team plan. You cannot add more members. There’s no security data, privacy support and stuff. It’s just one single person can use that. All the freelancers or single individual people. And then there’s the Adobes, the sales forces and all the other corporations building pretty hardcore tools, think of SAP, you cannot deploy an SAP as an ERP for any organization that has fewer than I would say, 500 people probably if you’re 200, maybe you can use it and not spend the 20 people’s time, full-time operating DRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the most part, you need to be a massive conglomerate to be able to use that. And unlike all of these, WordPress is probably the one, and if not one and only one of the very few ones, Drupal may probably fall in the same camp, but the one that’s super suitable for starting out being a freelancer or photographer or a journalist or blogger or so, but then at the same time serving universities and NASA and the White House and all the other different segments covering the enterprise. So the reason it’s so important is historically speaking in 2003, when WordPress started, it started as a blogging platform. It wasn’t supposed to be the go-to enterprise tool, while other players in the market were, that’s how they started. This was the pivot, this was the goal. And now we are managing, what is it, 43.5% or so of the web, but our enterprise coverage is still limited because we’re not talking enough about all the capabilities and opportunities of WordPress, which is why lots of enterprise are just not considering WordPress as one of the suitable tools to use, which is a shame. And that’s essentially why we have to talk more about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean, that probably speaks to the opportunity and challenge for WordPress and why it’s so important. In some ways, as you said, Brad, the majority of users aren’t enterprise users. It’s a fairly small user base, but actually as an economic segment of the WordPress economy or something, enterprise is actually huge. I dunno what the stats would be, but I imagine it’s up there, maybe hosting and e-commerce or something is larger, but probably after that, the enterprise part of the ecosystem is probably the third largest or something. And so the amount of money and resources that bring into the ecosystem is pretty large. And we see that the number of enterprise agencies that contribute means core or something. Again, it’s fairly sizable. So I think that’s just one factor. I think part of its importance is just the outside influence it has and the outside role it has to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in WordPress, I think also just the fact that these well-known brands, sure, maybe you’re just moving one website to WordPress when you’re doing NASA, but it’s such a well-known brand, it has this huge impact actually out in the market in terms of WordPress being taken seriously. I mean, one of the things I love about WordPress is that NASA are using WordPress core. You as a freelance photographer can go and download WordPress core and you get the same thing. That’s actually really not true. SAP is a good example. You wouldn’t want to use SAP if you were a freelance photographer, but you couldn’t even if you wanted to. There’s not that many products actually where that’s true, where you really get the same product. And so I think that’s another reason why it’s important. All of the innovation that happens at the enterprise tier can flow down and be available to everybody, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I mean that’s a great point. The innovation, and especially from open source, the more we contribute, we as a community within the WordPress project, the more anyone contributes, the better the project’s going to be, the better the software. And so the enterprise is bringing where we see those contributions, which many of these large organizations are starting to get into more, which is awesome. But we’re starting to see where they’re more focused on these areas that smaller sites would never even maybe run into those problems. Like the scalability side of it, right? The site’s going to have a million posts in one month, is that going to scale? So being able to contribute, you can go in there and actually help WordPress if there are bottlenecks, of course we know it can scale and can handle that, right? Especially if you have the right host and server setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But understanding if there are bottlenecks, I can think of a specific one. This was back, I don’t know, eight, 10 years ago. But as multi-site was starting to get more popular, networks were getting bigger, and WordPress was having a real challenge handling large networks. So if you imagine you have a thousand sites in your network and you got a network dropdown list, it would just bomb because it was trying to load all these sites. And same with users. If you had a million users, WordPress would just break because you couldn’t load a million. It would just break trying to pull that data back. These sites that were basically pushing WordPress to its limits, expose those limits. And now we have as a community worked on that and made it so it does scale. You can have an unlimited amount of users, unlimited amount of sites in the network, and it’s not just going to blow up, it’s going to work. And that all came from these larger builds, kind of pushing the limits and then discovering, Hey, we got to fix this. This isn’t going to scale if we don’t do something about it. And now it’s like I said, we’ve all seen it at scale on these massive networks or massive sites. So I love that idea of just those larger problems trickling down and hopefully being fixed within the enterprise teams and contributing back. That’s the number one thing. If they’re not contributing back then open source isn’t going to work anyways, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean, I think we’ve seen that play out right where it used to be. I mean, I think probably one of the reasons why Enterprise WordPress is kind of synonymous with just big WordPress is actually it was quite hard to do big WordPress back in the day. And so a lot of the stuff we were solving then as enterprise-like service providers was just scale and performance. But actually a lot of that has been solved. Now it’s not particularly hard to run WordPress at scale. And that’s thanks to that work trickling down being fed back directly and now we can focus on other stuff, which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />And going back to another point, I think, Tom, you might’ve made around kind of validating WordPress, you mentioned NASA, Whitehouse.gov, probably the number one, probably the most targeted government website in the world, probably one of ‘em at least, if not number one, is running WordPress. So being able to say that with full confidence as an agency owner trying to validate WordPress to an enterprise, there’s a lot of value behind</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that, right? No, we didn’t build that site, but somebody did it. It’s amazing. And it’s on WordPress, right? NASA is doing it. Whitehouse.gov is doing it. You can do it. Microsoft’s running it. Their whole security team does an annual audit of WordPress. If Microsoft says it’s okay to run it, it’s probably okay for you. So it helps validate and make these conversations easier, especially as we’re trying to bring WordPress to the table for a lot of these organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think, Mario, you mentioned earlier about Adobe, AEM. I can remember sales pitches where I’m sitting there in a boardroom of Viacom pitching WordPress and why all their sites should be on WordPress and some weren’t, and they’re trying to figure out what they wanted to go all in on. And then right behind us was Adobe with about 30 people, multiple professors of data science coming up there showing all, and I’m like, versus my much smaller team, I’m like, how do we compete? And that was where it was really eyeopening that we need to collectively within this community, those of us that are in the WordPress space, we need to work together. We need to put our voices together, our thoughts together and help lift WordPress into the enterprise base, which is exactly what we’re doing here, right? Exactly what Scale Consortium is doing, what we’re doing here, working with the WordPress core team and contributors, because now we’re working on the WordPress dot org slash enterprise page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn’t know that exists, go check it out. Not a ton to look at yet, but I promise you we’re working on it. And so it’s nice to see that things are happening because even just a couple of years ago, none of this, there wasn’t an enterprise page. We were all on our own trying to pitch WordPress and realizing that’s not going to get us where we need to go. So that’s why it’s important because WordPress actually grows because of the enterprise, just like it grows from small businesses using it. So it is a good thing for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to mention a little bit about the state of the Enterprise WordPress survey. So this has gone around and it was from 2023, so obviously we’re a little past the halfway mark of 2024, but I think it’s interesting to look at it retrospectively, but also I wanted to also highlight the fact that the 2024 survey is also live. So if you have not seen it, definitely go. It’s SOEWP.com, state of enterprise WordPress. SOEPW.com is where you can take the 2024 survey, but you can also view the results of last year’s survey. This is really spearheaded by a number of agencies. I think Big Bite and Human Made, you guys were pretty involved in this, and I know a lot of us were helping promote it because it’s getting data back, but essentially they interviewed approximately over a hundred corporations enterprise what would be considered enterprise level companies, enterprise brands, I should say Macy’s, NewsCorp. These are big, these are enterprise, right? Big WordPress the Times, and it got some really interesting data back. So if you guys have any data points that stand out, there are a few that stood out to me that I thought we should touch on, but if there’s any other data points you want to talk about, please, let’s do it because it’s interesting. I love this type of data. I haven’t seen this before specifically on WordPress and Enterprise, so just having anything to talk about and look at it I think is really interesting. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean that’s the first thing. I think before we get to the actual results, I think that this is such a great example of something that doesn’t happen unless we all get together and do it right, that we actually have a real lack of data underpinning what we’re doing and pooling our resources to put something like this together. It’s not actually a huge amount of work and it can bring a lot of value even though this one is a few months past now, it’s the first one. So actually we can learn a lot from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />In the next one. I would expect now that people know it’s there, I’m sure some people missed it. And now on the WordPress dot org slash enterprise page, they have linked it up with a nice banner at the bottom. So I would expect we’ll have quite a bit more data points for the next one. So definitely share it. If you listen to the show, check it out, share it with anyone, especially corporations that might actively want to fill this out. It can really help shape some of the future of WordPress, especially at the enterprise side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />What stood out to you from the actual results?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />So the one that stood out to me, I think really just like the important factors of choosing WordPress. This is something, as an agency owner, I like to know this. Why did they choose WordPress? What were the items that kind of pushed them over the edge? I think cost is always going to be one of those things that’s always going to be a bit of a factor. But when you’re in the enterprise, WordPress is probably one of the cheaper options when you really think about licensing and costs and Adobe and Sitecore and some others versus WordPress. WordPress is generally going to come out on top, probably almost in every case. It’s going to come out on top from a cost perspective. But the number one thing on this list in terms of what was the most important was functionality followed by scalability, extensibility, and usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s really about the flexibility of WordPress, which I guess that makes sense. That’s probably what I would assume too, but the WordPress is so flexible, scalable that they can really extend it to do what they need to do. And that is the core of enterprise because WordPress is not going to just install it and it’s ready for the enterprise. There is a lot you have to do to kind of get it ready. And a lot of that is customizations. And a lot of that’s really specific to the organization you’re working with because again, they have such unique setups and unique systems, and most of them, they may be on a WP engine or WordPressVIP, but many of them are not. A lot of them are still hosting their own stack or maybe they have their own hardware, which I know sounds crazy, but some of these organizations do because how they can control everything about what’s on that and who has control over that data, which is important to them. But on the flip side, something that caught my attention was the fact that multilingual capabilities were not as important, which I thought was kind of surprising. Every larger corporation I worked with, multilingual capabilities were important. Having localized content, especially in any region, there’s a global presence, an office or something of that company, but I’m really surprised it was over 57% said it’s not important. Over half said it’s not important. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, what’s your take on that, Mario? I wonder if that gels with what you would assume the importance of multilingual would be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Well, and that’s something that made an impression on me as well. So my personal way I’m interpreting this at least is first off, we do have a pretty sizable percentage of publishers here in that specific survey. So I would say that when we’re considering national publishers, particularly in, let’s say, the States or the UK or post-Australia, they wouldn’t be focusing that much on multilingual. That’s kind of one thing that stands out. We’ve been working with different, again, enterprises primarily in North America, they don’t care that much about multilingual. And again, as someone who lived in Europe, and my language, I’m not a native English speaker, I can totally understand how important this may be in certain scenarios. Again, you guys have worked with Microsoft or some of the other top orgs that have 12 languages in the dropdown by default. So for some that’s important, but this may not necessarily be the most integral factor here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that stands in mind that kind of stuck up here is I believe that they fully realize the power of workplace multi-site and the ability to launch different instances for different regions for sites because it’s pretty common in enterprise. Most if you go to Nike or the Louis Vuitton brand, you land on the landing page with lots of flags and say, Hey, which country? And then it leads you to some form of a localized website. So these are completely different standalone instances. And I think this is also pretty important to recognize enterprise are not afraid of maintaining 20 different websites, even though they may look alike and just run a DevOps tooling to upgrade all this at the same time, unlike what we do ourselves. But a couple of other things that stood out in the survey, first off, and Brad kind of briefly touched on that, but functionality like 70% of the IS functionality was very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the leading factor. 70% said WordPress is there for functionality. And I think we are not talking about this enough when I think of what are the options for an enterprise, they can go with a hosted kind of CMS through show, which of course it is hosted. It has a limited finite number of integrations, modules, developers through show. They can do bespoke, build a team and build something for three years and spend like $12 million just building a bespoke system and then still don’t have integrations or they can go open source. And when I think of open source, I just can’t think of any better solution that has, again, the flexibility</p>\n\n\n\n<p>, versatility, integration, feature set number of plugins or API integrations, we show it to WordPress. So I think this is pretty important. And last but not least, or actually two things, but I’ll try to do it real quick. First off is build cost. So 22% of the service that they build their enterprise MVP, like less than 50 grand. I challenge any enterprise to do the same with any other platform whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Is that a one-pager?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Well, yeah, maybe just a mockup. Maybe just a mockup. If their creative team doesn’t waste four times on charting a log or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />It’s just a strategy phase</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />And hosting costs. We get lots of enterprises migrating to us because they say, Hey, we find it better to pay, let’s say 10 grand a month retainer for you to changes because we pay more for hosting. So we are paying 15 grand, 20 grand or so for just keeping the lights on, no custom development or changes or human contact whatsoever. And we believe we can bring our hosting down to 2 to 5k a month and spend the other 10k and to essentially incur zero costs whatsoever and actually get professional development behind. So comparing that with what it actually costs, maintaining an enterprise system once it’s already there is something that is a place where WordPress really shines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I mean they’re all good points for sure. I did pick up on the cost thing and it’s hard to say less than 50,000, whatever that was, but there are smaller projects within Enterprise. But yeah, like you said, there’s usually a lot more hoops you have to jump through. So even a simple website turns into a much larger lift and build. The one area I think we really as a community need to work on or maybe as an enterprise we need to work on is contributing. So if you look at does your organization contribute to open source, 62% said no, just flat out, nope, we do not contribute. Now I do think you should take that with a grain of salt because that holds true if they’re not working with an agency, if they’re not working with outside partners, if it’s just their development team within their organization, they’re not contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a flat no. However, I bet this is a little bit mixed bag, right? Where the no is, no, we don’t. But we work with DevriX or we work with Human Made, may work with WebDevStudios and they do. It’s like indirectly by them hiring us and letting us build their sites and investing in not only their site but in us as an agency, we’re able to roll that forward into our five for the future efforts and our contribution efforts. I know of our agencies contribute to WordPress. I know that for a fact and we would not do that if we didn’t have an agency or did not have good clients that could allow us the time to do that. So I do think we should take that grain of salt. I’ve worked with a lot of enterprise companies that don’t contribute, but the agencies and companies that work with do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I think it’s something we could do quite a bit more around actually as a space, like you say, I think a lot of those companies don’t really realize that’s the case. We are probably not doing a good enough job of making that part of the pitch. I think it’s pretty common these days more and more common for this open source contribution stuff to fit quite nicely into goals or other initiatives that are happening in the enterprise. Again, there are dots that are probably not being connected. Even some kind of five for the Future Rep program that could extend to enterprise users of WordPress I think would be pretty interesting to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, the great way to look at it too is if your team, your developers are contributing. It’s not just putting things on the void and your corporation organization gets nothing out of it, right? Yes, they’re contributing to WordPress, which of course you’re going to directly benefit from, but you’re also leveling up your developers. They’re a hundred percent getting better at WordPress and understanding how WordPress works and getting into the core software and understanding how to read the code and how to work with Track and how to interact with the community. So your developers are going to level up, which means you’re going to get more out of them. The value is going to increase out of the salary versus benefits that you’re getting from them and work that you’re getting. So there are just a lot of advantages to it. But I think organizations, it’s a bit of a mindset shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They need to be working on our stuff. Why are they working over there? Well, they are working on your stuff by working over there and you can also prioritize initiatives within contributing that are important to your organization. It’s still contributing. It’s still helping. Even if you’re saying, I really want you to contribute to this thing, we kind of need it. It still helps everybody. So I don’t think that’s a bad thing. If you want to contribute one thing, if you’re looking for an easy ticket, get featured images automatically added into RSS feeds, that’s still out there. But if that’s important to your organization, your team could do that and it could probably get in the next release of WordPress. So that’s probably, like you say, there’s an educational component to it too of they just look at it as time they’re not spending on the business, but they actually kind of are. So that’s something we’re working on we&#8217;ll continue to work on because we love contributing to WordPress all of us. So it’s just working with these organizations and helping them understand how they can do it and how that benefits them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Something that jumped out to me in the survey that I’ll just mention at the end was the demographic of the respondents. I think something like 40, maybe slightly higher percent were leadership positions, which again, we’ve not been doing this survey before, but I would think that reflects a change compared to five, six years ago when actually WordPress was usually coming in bottom up. It wasn’t leadership led as I think that’s the stat I’ll be keeping an eye on over the surveys as we run them year on year. I think that for me tracks one of the major threads of enterprise WordPress as evolution. How do we go from bottom-up champion to leadership led?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, that’s actually a great point. You’re not wrong. It used to stubble up from it, the tech people that worked with it and kind of liked it and they were like, Hey, we should look at this. Or maybe even marketing had an angle on it too because they were familiar with it from a marketing angle. But yeah, seeing it from the top down, that is a bit of a shift and that’s a good shift. And then of course just around this one is very encouraging too, and we’ll wrap up the survey here, but around the block editor, right, we’re always talking about what is the adoption, who’s using the block editor? Are they on the old classic WYSIWYG editor? And by and large, it seems like they are adopting it. There’s only about 19% that said they’re still on classic. And I think I was thinking about this.<br />I’m like, I’m sure this is largely impacted by the fact that corporations and enterprise have budgets. They have money they can invest to say we need to upgrade. This is the new thing, we got to get on it. Whereas smaller and medium businesses, if they just rebuilt their site a couple of years ago, they’re not going to reinvest to do it just to get blocks right now, if you’re a media site, you should because the value you’re bringing to your editors is going to be worth it. But a lot of sites, it’s just not there. So I would imagine that’s part of it. But just to see the adoption with the block editor being so high, and to be fair, about 27% is both so kind of a mixed bag, but at least they are using some blocks and then 54%, so over half is they’re all in on the block editor in Gutenberg. So that’s nice to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, it’d be interesting to compare that to the broader, I dunno how that compares to broader usage of block editor, but I did that. I think that also connects back to the previous point where actually a lot of us who are doing enterprise work, were involved in the block editor because we are part of the project. And so we were able to bring that experience very early to our clients. A lot of us were launching Production Enterprise on the plugin before it was even merged into core. Whereas a lot of the broader web ecosystem, that transition has been more difficult. The ramp ups were more difficult learning a whole new thing, whereas I think of enterprise agencies didn’t face that so much. We were involved already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, a hundred percent. It’s such a game changer for organizations, especially media organizations. Once they see it, there’s that light bulb moment. Oh yeah, we definitely want that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, demo’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Cool. Well, we’re kind of coming up on time, so I want to briefly just touch on upcoming events. I know we have WordCamp US coming up, so if you’re anywhere you want to come, it’s in Portland, Oregon and it’s coming up on September 17th, 20th. I will be there. Are either one of you going to be able to make WordCamp US this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I will also be there. Yeah, looking forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad</p>\n\n\n\n<p>:<br />Yeah, Tom will be there. Mario, you got to make it over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />It’s close to school year, so unfortunately I’ll be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I know. Yeah, timing gets tough. The timing of WordCamp US is always a little bit tough with school. I think last year was the week right before school started for me. I know it’s different everywhere, but you got to kind of juggle that with the family, right? So it’ll be a really fun event. So Tom and I will be there, a number of members of the Scale Consortium with the group of agencies that are working with the enterprise. So if you’re there, track us down. Love to talk, WordPress Talk, enterprise, all that good stuff. I want to give you both a chance to promote where people can find you online if they want to reach out and talk to you, blog, your website, company, Twitter, X, whatever. So Tom, where can people track you down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Probably Twitter is the best, just my name @Tom Willmot. You should check out scaleconsortium.org if you’re interested in what we’re doing over there. And this general initiative to come together as an enterprise WordPress space and grow the pie for us all and humanmade.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. Hey Mario, where can everyone find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Yeah, LinkedIn and Twitter are going to be the two best places. Look up Mario Peshev and more than happy to chat. If you need any WordPress or B2B growth solutions, DevriX.com is the place to go. And if you have any questions about enterprise, I’m pretty sure that all of us are going to be more than happy to help out. We are not just spending a hundred percent of our time on just sales pitches and closing business. We definitely want to make WordPress for the enterprise a better place and educating a lot for free writing books, giving sessions and podcasts and lots of different events. So it’s a completely different culture than what you’re probably used to IT webinars and sales pitches and BDR calls as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />WordPress is a fun side of enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Definitely less stuffy over here. Come on in. The water’s fine, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love the fact you both called it Twitter. I’m still in the Twitter camp, so I’m on Twitter still somehow. Williamsba and over at webdevstudios.com if you want to check out our professional side of things. But this has really been a lot of fun. I’m really excited about the show. I want to bring on a lot of different guests and get different experiences. I want to bring on not just agencies, I want to bring on site administrators, site owners, I want to bring on marketing. I want to bring on people that are using WordPress in the enterprise and really hear about their experiences. Good, bad, otherwise, right? But get a lot of people from Scale Consortium on here as well because they’re all working within the enterprise. So it’s going to be a lot of fun. So if you’re interested in coming on the show, please reach out to myself or Bob WP, you can hit us up. And we’re in most of the WordPress Slacks post status, so love to have you on and looking forward to some future episodes on WordPress and the enterprise, the inside view. So I appreciate it, Tom. Mario, thanks for joining and we’ll see everyone next time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario:<br />Great chat everyone. See you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />See you next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this first episode of <strong><em>The Inside Track</em></strong> via our show, <strong><em>Scaling Enterprise, WordPress and OSS</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Brad Williams</strong> and <strong>Tom Willmot</strong>, along with special guest <strong>Mario Peshev from DevriX</strong>, introduce you to the world of enterprise WordPress. Together, they share the unique challenges and opportunities of using WordPress at scale within large organizations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They discuss the definition of enterprise in the context of WordPress, share insights from their extensive experience running their own agencies, and highlight key findings from the State of Enterprise WordPress survey. Additionally, they touch on the importance of contributing to open source, and the impact of multilingual capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Definition of Enterprise WordPress</strong>: Enterprise WordPress refers to large-scale WordPress implementations that cater to big projects or companies, often requiring customized solutions to meet complex needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Functionality</strong>: The primary reason enterprises choose WordPress is its flexibility and functionality, which allows it to be extended and customized to meet specific organizational requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: WordPress is often a more cost-effective option compared to other enterprise solutions, making it an attractive choice for companies looking to manage their budgets while achieving robust functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Multilingual Capabilities</strong>: Surprisingly, multilingual capabilities were not deemed as critical by many enterprises, despite the expectation that larger organizations would prioritize localized content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contribution to Open Source</strong>: A significant number of enterprises do not directly contribute to open source. However, many indirectly support contributions through the agencies they work with, which invest time and resources back into the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leadership Involvement</strong>: There is a shift towards leadership-led adoption of WordPress in enterprises, indicating that decision-makers are recognizing the value and capabilities of WordPress for large-scale projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adoption of the Block Editor</strong>: A majority of enterprises have adopted the Gutenberg block editor, showing a trend towards utilizing the latest WordPress features to enhance content management and editing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community and Collaboration</strong>: The episode emphasizes the importance of collaboration within the WordPress community to continue advancing the platform, particularly in the enterprise space, and highlights initiatives like Scale Consortium.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://scaleconsortium.org/\">Scale Consortium</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://soewp.com/\">Take the survey &#8220;State of Enterprise WordPress, 2024 Report&#8221; </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://soewp.com/2023-report/\">See the report for the 2023 State of Enterprise WordPress</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 08:50:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"Do The Woo Community: A Deep Dive into Block Bindings, APIs, and the LSX Tour Operator Plugin with Ash Shaw\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-deep-dive-into-block-bindings-apis-and-the-lsx-tour-operator-plugin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49606:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-36 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-35 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-8 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-34 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-15 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-33 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1650\" height=\"1650\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/avalara-logo-_dtw.png?resize=1650%2C1650&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-75400\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-16\"><strong><a href=\"https://developer.avalara.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Avalara</a></strong>: help developers make sure their Woo projects are tax compliance done right with Avalara&#8217;s API.

I am here with Carl Alexander, as usual, and Carl, I see Carl board peeking over your shoulder there. How are the two of you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Always, always creeping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Right? Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I mean, he&#8217;s doing what he needs to do. Creep out people on Zoom calls and also scare children at birthday parties. That&#8217;s his retirement life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I am coming up on an interesting milestone. I believe the first time that we met was at a WordCamp Minneapolis and it&#8217;s just around the corner again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That&#8217;s good that you remember because most of my interactions with people are like, I don&#8217;t remember the first time I met you. I just know, I don&#8217;t remember not knowing you. We crossed paths so many times and I was like, but I don&#8217;t know when it was. I just don&#8217;t know when it was the first time. I think my most vivid memory of, okay, I really know this person was like, and we met a few times already, was at Pressnomics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />You were sitting in the lobby talking to someone, I don&#8217;t know who, but you were sitting in the hotel lobby having a chat with someone and I just remember, I dunno, that&#8217;s my most vivid memory of, okay, this is Zach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think my most vivid memory was in one of the after parties. We were in a large venue and it was you, me, Michelle Schulp, and a few other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah. I think most people&#8217;s most vivid, vivid memories of me are after parties. I was going to say the same. If you ask Robert Jacobi, that&#8217;s all he talks about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Right, and I have to correct myself. It&#8217;s Michelle Schulp Hunt now. Congratulations, Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Oh yeah, Michelle Schulp Hunt. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah. So WordCamp Minneapolis is right around the corner. It&#8217;s coming up on August 16th. I will be there. It&#8217;s at the Mall of America this year. So if you&#8217;re listening to this episode and you are anywhere near Minneapolis St. Paul, please come join us. Go to Minneapolis dot WordCamp dot org slash 2024 and I would love to see some of you there. Maybe we can have an onsite dev chat with some of the people. So yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;ll be a good time. And then right around the corner after that is WordCamp US in Portland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, so I&#8217;ll be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I will definitely be there as well. And it&#8217;s going to be, I think, a really good camp from everything that I&#8217;m seeing. The venue looks cool now. Everything looks like it&#8217;s going to be a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Is it going to be Portland weird?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think so. And I think that you may have just introduced yourself. So for anybody who is wondering what the third voice there is, that is Ash Shaw. Ash, why don&#8217;t you give us a little bit of an introduction of yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Hi, I am Ash. Yeah, I&#8217;m 43 now. I started my career in tech back in &#8217;99 when Microsoft was trying to find cheap labor. So they came up with MCSE. I quickly learned that that wasn&#8217;t really that much fun and we&#8217;ve got a great Linux community in Cape Town called Plug Cape Linux User Group. I discovered them through a friend and a few people in the group showed me some tricks. I fell in love with open source, more specifically open source in the broader term. I got a CIS admin job at a university. Moved on from that to starting Lightspeed Development, which I shortened to Lightspeed back in 2003. We moved to working with WordPress in about 2007. The inspiration came from something called BarCamp. BarCamp Cape Town. They were kind of informal community organized events, not about specific tech, but about tech in general. I met a very interesting person back then, Jeremy Thurgood, who was working on Amazon&#8217;s cloud infrastructure way back then. I just remember he had this bizarre device attached to his laptop that was a security device, so anything in and out of his laptop was encrypted. Back then it was a brick of a laptop with this giant device attached. Very bizarre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That&#8217;s crazy. I&#8217;d never heard of that, but that sounds like really…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />I&#8217;d never seen that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s like crazy. And I did some work with law firms, so they were pretty security conscious, but the best we had was the original RSA 2FAs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah, to be honest, I don&#8217;t remember what it was exactly. I just remember he said it was to encrypt the data and anything going in and out of his laptop. Yeah. Then I met another chap who introduced me to WordPress and blogging and I realized that there was a whole community behind it and communities have always intrigued me and I&#8217;m a social person, so I started getting involved in trying to find more events and then I think it was one of the first 10 WordCamps that happened in Cape Town. Matt Mullenweg attended. It was back in 2008. It was what sparked a serious round of inspiration and drive to actually learn more. My lead developer is still with my company. He joined us back in, I think it was December 2006. So that was a long time ago. And we&#8217;ve had an interesting journey through the different versions of WordPress and we built for a political party, the Democratic Alliance. We built a multi-site blogging network on an initial alpha of BuddyPress. We&#8217;ve never done that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I wonder why. I wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />It was the first forever. My lead developer said never again if I&#8217;m going to continue working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It&#8217;s so funny. One of my first projects at an agency with WordPress was around BuddyPress and I was like, what was the forum? The one that turned into the BBPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />The forum BBPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It was BBPress. Okay, yeah. I was like, no, never again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />No, they didn&#8217;t integrate properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />But it made it so complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It&#8217;s gotten better now, but it is still complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />I think Andy Peatling, who originally worked on it, I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s still involved, but I know JJJ, he&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Not, he&#8217;s not. He&#8217;s at Automattic. But I met Andy Peatling when we were using BuddyPress because I used BuddyPress as my initial way of structuring complex code and large code bases in WordPress. That was the only large code base I was aware of. So he came to WordCamp Montreal and I remember talking with him and just saying thank you. I would have no idea how to structure this code. Just like we were doing really large projects. And I&#8217;m like, how do people do this? It&#8217;s like, this is insane. And then the only example we had was BuddyPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah. So the BuddyPress was quite interesting. I worked with it for quite a while. And then my passion for the community and all of that drove me to organize a couple of WordCamps in Cape Town. Then I handed over to the community in 2014. I remember it was the last WordCamp San Francisco, and I managed to get in to join the WordPress Summit where we mapped out the next year of the roadmap. It was really fascinating. And somebody at WooThemes, I was complaining to them about Canvas theme and how they kept making changes and they kept breaking all of our site&#8217;s CSS classes changing and this and that, and it was a nightmare. And he said, well, if you have a problem with it, build your own. And I thought to myself, good idea. And we based it on underscores initially and that classic theme. We were stuck with Bootstrap three until, well, it&#8217;s still got Bootstrap three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn&#8217;t know how to change that. And then last year we built, or the previous theme is LSX, the classic theme. And then last year we built LSX design, which was a block-based theme, and that meant we almost had to relearn everything. I took a bit of a sabbatical in 2020 to 2021, a one-year sabbatical. And when I came back in 2022, I started researching things again and I was like, what is happening? Everything&#8217;s changed. And at the WordCamp Porto I was inspired to go down that rabbit hole. And you guys mentioned ADHD. Well, I&#8217;m in the same boat and I went deep and yeah, it&#8217;s been a great journey, I must say, figuring out where to take this product, learning all new skills. My team has been on board and we&#8217;ve had a blast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I think that&#8217;s why a lot of people with ADHD like to be solopreneurs or start their own thing and stuff, because a lot of ADHD people that I know also just love learning. They love learning new stuff. You get a nice dopamine hit whenever you skill up at things. So what&#8217;s the easiest way to skill up at is to just do a whole bunch of things, which business requires you to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />It&#8217;s been a journey I&#8217;ve gone through multiple times, right? I&#8217;ve talked about this on the show before, but I was a flash developer and I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re aware, but that kind of disappeared overnight. So we definitely ended up having to retool a whole bunch of us into new technologies. And that&#8217;s how I ended up finding WordPress was as part of that retooling. I actually learned UX and went through a whole bunch of UX courses during that time too. And my first job after Flash was in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a role as a UX architect, so I stepped away from development for a little while and broadened my horizons a bit and learned some design, learned some other things around what makes good user experience, and then came back to development and WordPress basically full bore after that. And the gateway to me really getting involved with WordPress was WooCommerce, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here. So yeah, I mean that whole learning new things, it&#8217;s something that we are remarkably good at when it&#8217;s something we find interest in. The problem is if we don&#8217;t find interest in it, it&#8217;s very hard for us to then focus and work on it. At least I find that for myself, if I&#8217;m not interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I&#8217;ve had the luck that I am pretty good at delayed gratification. So that really helps I think for that because yeah, it&#8217;s really easy. I know a lot of people that are like, oh, and they&#8217;re shifting to new things right away, and it&#8217;s hard to stay focused and do the consistent work that is required to get good at anything. Really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />The WooCommerce software got launched at WordCamp Cape Town 2012, and that was one of the events I organized. And at that point I was working with WPEcommerce by Dan Millwood and Jeff Ward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, I remember them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />I think Dan Mill moved into gaming. I&#8217;m not sure what happened to Jeff. He was a really great developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, I remember Dan. We were in a couple of private Facebook groups together. I hadn&#8217;t heard his name in so long, but yeah, I remember when because they tried to get it back up and going for a little bit and then you moved on to something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah, gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />So my first real introduction to WooCommerce was building a digital marketplace for a record label that I was a part of. And so all digital, all downloads, and that was a benefit of WooCommerce that most other e-commerce platforms didn&#8217;t have at the time was the ability to create a digital marketplace really easily. We did that for every artist that was on our record label. We had a website where you could buy all of the music we had, and that was 2012 that we started the project for that. And that was built on the white light theme from Woo and just very, very early days of WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last month we had Beka Rice on and we were talking about the wild west of WooCommerce development. And back then there was a board where you could go and choose plugins you wanted to develop. And that&#8217;s how all of the plugin development that became the marketplace started was with a board of ideas that people claimed things on. And so it&#8217;s really kind of interesting to see where we are today, and probably more importantly for this conversation to see that WooCommerce itself is inspiring some of the things that other people are doing, yourself included. So why don&#8217;t we talk just a little bit about where, first of all, you&#8217;ve done a large update to your plugin and that&#8217;s the LSX tour operator plugin, and you&#8217;ve been using some really, really new cutting edge features and WordPress. But first let&#8217;s talk about the inspiration that you drew from WooCommerce as you started this process of rebuilding your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />I&#8217;d say it all started with the block theme that we developed last year. We were working with Frank Klein from WP Development Courses. He was mentoring our team on block development practices, best practices, things like that. What an amazing man. He has a wealth of knowledge, I swear. He lives on the GitHub issues for WordPress and Gutenberg. You mention something and he is like, oh, well, and he goes and digs up a ticket that he was the one who either started or facilitated a bunch of information towards. So then because my company is a Woo expert company, we wanted our theme to be deeply integrated with Woo blocks. That was a bit of a nightmare last year and still somewhat of a challenge this year, but in the past six months, I must say it&#8217;s gotten better, exponentially better. So we decided to add support for a lot of the block themes. I mean, the blocks that were beta blocks because I didn&#8217;t really like the original blocks, to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The product blocks that they had, they had a number of separate blocks that they then replaced with the product collection block. And the way they did that, it was really impressive for me. It&#8217;s basically like a container. And then recently you would, when you want to add a product collection, it gives you a number of templates, like five specific templates and then one general kind of default one. And that really stuck in my head. Then another one of the blocks, which is still beta product collection, came out of beta recently is the gallery beta. And that one&#8217;s so much better than the old gallery block. And I have another e-commerce site back in South Africa. It&#8217;s a side project of mine, and I build that using my company&#8217;s open source theme, and it&#8217;s like a test ground for all of what we are doing. So when something comes out, I will test everything possible. I&#8217;ll try this config and that config and that config and figure out what doesn&#8217;t work. So then I write up GitHub issues for my teammates, and then they will add support. Either it&#8217;s new support for a new WordPress release, and I must say that 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 releases, they just bounce the functionality and capabilities radically. And then when I was at WordCamp Europe recently, I was demoing what we are doing with the Woo blocks to both the CEO of WooCommerce, and he and Pi were really excited about this. They loved what we were doing. We&#8217;ve got full compatibility for all their blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we started on this venture of redeveloping our classic PHP-based tour operator plugin, which I was quite honestly scared of doing when we started building that plugin. It&#8217;s also an open source plugin, and it was built to work with our classic theme. And the reason it never really got adopted was because it only worked with that one theme. It was too much to actually get it to work with many themes. We would&#8217;ve needed to write so much code to add compatibility. Now with block themes and blocks, this opens a whole lot of potential. We haven&#8217;t done the testing with other themes yet, but I imagine that things are going to work pretty or better than ever they ever did in the past. So we&#8217;ve been looking at how I was just to unpack a little bit more about the tour operator plugin is it&#8217;s got three core post types with four or five taxonomies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can imagine those are quite a number of templates. So these templates are needed to map out the block-based templates. They can&#8217;t all just run off essential all archives templates. They each need their own one because they have a host of custom fields. So what I&#8217;m working with my developer on is how we can approach this in a similar way to the product collection block where we&#8217;ll come up with hopefully one query loop type of block for all the post types, but realistically we&#8217;ll probably need to do a few for each of the main post types that we&#8217;re still experimenting with. So then another thing that I&#8217;ve got earmarked is the pattern assembler within WooCommerce for customizing the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been testing, it&#8217;s not in the main release yet from what I understand. I think it&#8217;s in a future release. It&#8217;s only in the beta versions, but I imagine if I had eight pairs of fonts for a tour operator site and the ability to then define site logo and site icon and all of that sort of thing through a similar interface that would radically reduce the time that we need to build sites. What we have done with quite a lot of success so far is migrated the many custom fields. So just to give you an idea, a single tour, we will have a couple of the main fields. It&#8217;s got its normal WordPress fields, title, excerpts, body, but then we&#8217;ve also got a, there&#8217;s a featured image, which is standard, but then we also have a hero image that could be a wide image that isn&#8217;t very tall or high. And then a host of values like price and day-by-day itineraries are repeatable groups of fields. So day one or day one to day three, we&#8217;ll then have a number of fields. We solved those in the past using CMB2, which is a good framework. It worked well for us. Have you guys got experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That&#8217;s old? I&#8217;ve used it before. It&#8217;s been around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I feel like I saw it almost 10 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />So we can bypass a lot of that. We need it for some of the things that we want to achieve, but with the block bindings API we&#8217;re able to hook into the original slugs that we&#8217;d created for the custom fields. And one of the things that we&#8217;ve developed for our tour operator plugin is an integration with a data partner. So they&#8217;re called whereto.com and they have two types of customers, accommodation providers and tour operators. The accommodation providers pump in their accommodation information like descriptions, rooms, all of that sort of thing. And then tour operators, when they create digital itineraries, they would say, I start in this city and I go to that city and I go to this region, and then they create a really rich media itinerary. But now to display that on a website, you could just embed it with an iframe, but that&#8217;s not great. So we built an integration to their rest API that literally connects to every single data point they have for destinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />You cache that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Well, we actually import it and we&#8217;ve set up triggers that it&#8217;ll poll a specified cron job to check at certain times. Is there a change? Pull it in. We&#8217;ve got rules that we can set up where if the WordPress side has been changed, then it won&#8217;t change. It won&#8217;t import and overwrite. Or maybe you do want it to, there</p>\n\n\n\n<p>are a host of ways we can configure nonetheless, the where to importer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />You happy with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s working really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I&#8217;m a big fan of consuming API now. I think that&#8217;s way better than a lot of stuff that we had to do early on, like you said, iframes or I feel like that&#8217;s a nice change of the development landscape in the last 10 years as people are just like, now let me just do an API for this. And then they just let you pull the data and then you get it yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />So much better. It does become somewhat unwieldy because imagine that you have 500 accommodation listings attached to 50 tours or a hundred tours and all of the images attached to that, and then the people who load the accommodation data, they don&#8217;t necessarily know that images need to be resized and whatnot. So we over the years had to develop methods to resize images on import scale things. And with the day-by-day itineraries, there aren&#8217;t actually images attached to an individual day. So we managed to create a way for it to automatically assign a random image to the day, for example. And that would be an image from the accommodation listing that&#8217;s attached to that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />One of the things that we&#8217;ve done to interlink the different post types is to use a version of Posts 2 Posts by Scribu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I remember that. Yep. Oh my God. Yeah, he&#8217;s the OG WPCLI developer too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />He discontinued development on that plugin, but that&#8217;s not an issue because we&#8217;ve modified it and brought it into our system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />And it wasn&#8217;t a lot of code, if I remember correctly. It was easy to, if you wanted to just pull it into your own code base, it wasn&#8217;t a huge, it was one of those small plugins that do a lot, that can do a lot of lifting, but code-wise, it wasn&#8217;t like, oh, this is so big that there&#8217;s no way we can bring this into our own code base. It was simple. So it was good. It was easy for other developers to just look at what he did and bring it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think context is important here for people who aren&#8217;t familiar. So what the Posts 2 Posts plugin did was it allowed you to create many relationships between posts. And as we know, or you may not know if you&#8217;re listening to this, posts are everything in WordPress pretty much. So pages are posts. Posts are posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It&#8217;s like the core data type of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />WooCommerce orders are post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, everything&#8217;s a post type, which is why the scaling issue that we basically were beating the dead horse of the high-performance order tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, now that high-performance order storage exists, it&#8217;s not quite a post type anymore for orders, which is a good thing. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I was thinking about that too. You were describing your data model earlier and I was like, oh, I wonder how you were saying, I mean, you&#8217;ll have issues like scaling with anything with WordPress. You were talking about 500 accommodations and 80 tours, and that can have an impact as well on performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />With the importer, it does in time. So you can imagine the number of images that get imported into the database for each listing and all of that. So that&#8217;s something where we&#8217;ve learned how to manage the larger sites. Most smaller sites, it&#8217;s not an issue on the larger sites. We manage those on a case-by-case basis. But yeah, the post-to-post really helped us create the relationships. So for example, if you import a tour, you&#8217;ll have those accommodation items connected. You&#8217;ll also connect destinations. Destinations are hierarchical, like pages are hierarchical where you&#8217;ve got a top level and a sub-level. So a destination is to the top level is a country and the sub-level is a region. And those have different templates. So if you were on a country, you don&#8217;t display accommodation, but you do display featured tours. Tours move through a country, they also move through a region, but accommodation would only display on a region template, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, one of the next things that we&#8217;ve got planned is obviously with all of this kind of data, searching for the information for the end user is critical. And we&#8217;ve used FacetWP for a long time and sometimes SearchWP, although I&#8217;m not sure that that helps the performance very much. It does sometimes help having a search engine. But FacetWP is a great plugin for our needs. So we built a little integration to the classic plugin. Now they have a block. It&#8217;s just really for short codes. It&#8217;s not really a true block, and we do some styling around that. Ideally, what I want to be doing with in the future, and it&#8217;s on our roadmap, is something like Woo filters where you&#8217;ve got your active filters, your price slider, filter by post type, filter by taxonomy, filter by featured, and something that we have that filtering on archives being your top level or category top level for a post type being all tours or a category archive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those filters can be relevant to that post type or that category. But then what happens when you search globally, because a lot of people want to search the site globally. So then we&#8217;ve come up with a solution using Facet WP where one of the filters will be content type. So say that user does a search in the header for Cape Town where I&#8217;m from, and it comes up with blog posts, pages, destinations, tours, accommodation reviews, special offers, and maybe a team members even attached to mentions Cape Town. So then that filtering allows you to filter by content type. So that&#8217;s something we haven&#8217;t started with that yet, but I mapped everything out for it today actually while I was chatting about things with my developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the checkout block is something I want to start pulling apart as an inquiry because I would like customers in the future, or not customers, but users of the plugin in the future, not to have to depend on a form plugin. And I was thinking that if we could do something like a checkout block, but an inquiry block where I drop it into either a section on the page or a mode or something like that, that would be really great to post that information to a post type like orders, but it would be inquiries. And if you think about the block bindings API, so if you&#8217;ve got a single tour, we&#8217;ve managed to get the vast majority of fields to output properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;m not sure how my developer is going to solve, but he has a plan is as I mentioned, that repeatable field, we have repeatable fields for gallery images as well. So if you add an image, you need to add alt information, alt tags, you need to add maybe a caption or you add a host of info. So that part that&#8217;s on the roadmap. But we are very happy with the first part of the rebuild. A lot of it was done via the site editor and I did that and with the help of my developer. Then once I designed all the layouts, he would help me add some of the block bindings code to the plugin, then I&#8217;d work with it a little bit. I&#8217;d do some designs, he&#8217;d take my block templates, he&#8217;d put them into the plugin, and then I&#8217;d do some more and back and forth like that. So it&#8217;s been a really fun journey and amazing to push the limits of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, because that&#8217;s all relatively new too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Do you feel it&#8217;s stable enough? Like you worry that they&#8217;ll, one of the things that with the Gutenberg experiment is that things have not been always that stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />So one of the things that I&#8217;m a little bit worried about now, we&#8217;ve looked into it, and again, my worry has a plan for that, but that is the change of the theme to theme JSON 3, where there are now defined spacing values that are within the theme JSON and or name spaces. I&#8217;m not sure what the correct terminology is. And also for font sizes or font names, should I say the sizes? You can decide because when we started last year, I was in discussion with Carolina who had done an audit of a hundred block themes, and she had taken the average of different naming for both spacing and for font sizes. So they&#8217;ve changed a few things from what the average in the community was, and that is going to probably cause HAC because then those changes, either we are going to do a find and replace in the database or I&#8217;m interested to see how we do that. And I just redeveloped my company website, so I spent a lot of time setting font sizes and setting spacing and using our own theme JSON values. So I imagine that&#8217;s going to take some time to refactor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />So it&#8217;s my understanding that it only uses the new defaults if there&#8217;s nothing set in the theme already. So it shouldn&#8217;t override anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />No, it won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m somebody who likes to do things the WordPress way, and I would like future sites that we develop to use the new naming space namespace. And I think rather following what the standards are than trying to do your own thing is a better approach. And it&#8217;s becoming much easier to do that with theming, with block themes now, before it was the Wild West with themes, I mean classic themes that developed their own options frameworks, and that was a nightmare. So I want to steer clear of that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, I think we&#8217;re finally getting out of the world where the theme could be a kitchen sink theme, right? Where it included a whole bunch of functionality that wasn&#8217;t in any way related to anything it needed to be. And so I think we&#8217;re finally moving away from that with block themes, and hopefully we&#8217;ll get away from the world where people had this necessity to package 482 plugins with their theme just to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>make it look like it had more functionality than it did because that&#8217;s been a horrible practice the whole time. And that&#8217;s what I call a kitchen sink theme, right? It&#8217;s everything and the kitchen sink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Those are really, really horrible practices to just have a theme do more than theme, right? That&#8217;s plugin territory and always should have been, but we ended up building themes that did way more than just the visual theming of a site. And so I think this starts to refocus themes as being themes and not theme plus functionality. Patterns are a theme-related thing. And the ability to set patterns in your theme JSON for your theme and share patterns that you&#8217;ve created in the pattern library is huge, right? That gives us new design capability. It doesn&#8217;t relegate us to only being able to use the things that are available inside the available blocks. We now have these groupings of patterns that are also available. And it looks like in your theme, you have a number of patterns. They actually look really great, and you have all of these available to make sure that people have all the building blocks they need, plus all of these design templates to start from as they&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yeah, the patterns were an interesting journey for us when we started. We didn&#8217;t know what to do to be quite honest. Now we have a much better concept of how we could use patterns and what we need to use them for. So the patterns that are in our C1 WordPress dot org are quite literally following what a lot of people in last year were doing. Frost wp, for example, was our inspiration. So then we made some changes to our color scheme and the patterns aren&#8217;t looking great at the moment, so I&#8217;m busy working on some patent changes for next week&#8217;s release and we&#8217;re going to be sorting out colors and that sort of thing. As we were talking about earlier, the learning i dopamine hits, well, it was a bit of a light bulb moment when I started creating some patterns for our own company website in the most recent rebuild. And now I know what full page patterns I want to create, and those full page patterns are going to be made up of useful smaller patterns, not just random team patterns and random testimonial patterns and things like that. I know what I want now. I just need to finish building them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think the other really cool thing I saw that you&#8217;ve done is you&#8217;ve actually released a Figma design system document that fits alongside your plugin and it&#8217;s a design system in general. You have a style guide, but you&#8217;ve made extensive use of Figma variables. And I think that&#8217;s huge because I&#8217;ve been digging further and further into Figma lately. I had a baseline knowledge, but I&#8217;m really digging into components and how creating components with variants works and being able to build a library of interactive things that you can build your prototypes with. And the power is just so deep in what Figma can do. So seeing that you&#8217;ve built a toolkit that&#8217;s built very similarly to the way that I&#8217;m trying to do the work that I do right now in Figma is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />That was an interesting journey as well, because we started the Figma file last year and we created three separate files, a style guide file, a WordPress file, and a WooCommerce file because we thought that was a good idea to separate them. It would be if you were in a large organization doing a large design system for IBM or something like that, or Uber, A lot of them do these separate files, and that&#8217;s where I took some of my inspiration from. But then this year we decided when we did a radical upgrade on the design system to merge everything into a single file, and we started with the LSX design theme, and we called it the LSX design system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there we created two sections within it, major sections other than the style guide and the cover, and that was for the WordPress pages and elements. And we broke those down by components and then blocks and then patterns and template parts and full page layouts and templates. And then we did a WooCommerce section in a similar structure. And then recently after WordCamp Europe, as I mentioned, they really liked what we were doing. So I got the idea to showcase what we&#8217;re doing with WooCommerce in a prototype. And my teammate, Zared, has done the most incredible prototype. The Woo prototype actually allows you to add to cart and you can add up to four products to your mini cart. You can view the mini cart, you can empty the mini cart, you can search. It&#8217;s insane. And we really pushed the limits of variables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last year, none of that was actually possible because what we were researching was the lead designer, I forget his name right now, the lead designer from GitHub was working on design tokens and it was a separate system. And we stumbled, I stumbled upon it through the WordPress vip.com websites and their blog where they were doing stuff in Figma and then exporting to theme JSON and pretty much populating the theme JSON with the colors and fonts and values that you would need or that you were working on in Figma. That was really powerful. But now this year, Figma has next leveled it. And when we started on the LSX tour operator design system, we put so much work into the variables and the naming conventions and all of that, we forked the file on the LSX design file, and we came up with that as a basis for the tour operator plugin came up with new colors because it has a different color scheme. We&#8217;ve gone from more of a safari color scheme. And then we left the Woo prototype in there while we were generating the tour operator prototype. We could only start that obviously once we&#8217;d finished all the templates for a tour operator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s been an interesting revelation because the WooCommerce prototype was very much variable heavy and quite technical and interactive. Whereas the tour operator one is more of a clickable prototype. There&#8217;s less that you can do with it. We don&#8217;t add anything to a cart. We also don&#8217;t really need to test doing filling in a checkout form or something like that. So that sort of thing is unnecessary. And we decided to focus on creating a very clear prototype design that will guide us for the coming months of our development on the tour operator plugin. So that&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve got to say, been very rewarding and satisfying. My teammate, Zared, has in the space of four months, gone from zero Figma knowledge to advanced Figma design. He wasn&#8217;t even a designer before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s awesome. Now I want to be an advanced Figma person. All I&#8217;ve had is Figma stuff shared with me. And then I just look at it a bit and it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the extent of my interaction is with Figma. I&#8217;m kind of hyped up just hearing you talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />It&#8217;s really, it&#8217;s amazing. And their videos on the YouTube channel, their own videos are incredible. They all come with Figma files, workspace files, you can learn so much. And unfortunately, they made a radical interface change this week. I think it was this week. I opened it up on Monday I think it was, and I was like, what&#8217;s happening? Where is everything? My teammates had the same thing. We needed to get stuff done, and the two of us were faffing trying to figure out, oh, where&#8217;s this? And where&#8217;s now we&#8217;ve got it. But it was the most radical interface change I&#8217;ve seen in an application in ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, they announced all of that at Config that they were going to be changing the UI considerably. And just to bring this full circle to where we started today with talking about history, I have known Sho Kuwamoto, who is the VP of product at Figma, and I&#8217;ve known him for a very long time. He was the senior director of engineering at Adobe for the tools portion of Flex and was very responsible for the creation of Flash Catalyst, which was a design tool for the Flex framework. And so he&#8217;s been at Figma now for nine years. And so a lot of the beauty of what Figma is came out of learnings that happened in the Flash world. And so very, very cool stuff. And we are now seeing the benefit of all of that history. And so if you are interested in any way in learning a little bit about that history, there was a session during Config, which is Figma&#8217;s conference for those of you who are listening who don&#8217;t know about the impact of Flash on Figma and in general on the world. And so if you want to see where all of this stuff that we&#8217;re doing now came from back in the final days of we were innovating very quickly, and all of those innovations JavaScript has finally caught up to. So there&#8217;s been a very large gap in time that the things that we used to do in Flash have not been possible, or at least not as easy to do by any means. And so now we&#8217;ve gotten to a point where it&#8217;s all come full circle and tools like Figma exist because of that history. So really, really cool stuff. So I think that&#8217;s a really good spot to start to wrap up here today. It&#8217;s been really great getting to know some of your processes here. And I&#8217;m sure we could probably talk for another hour or two, but I think that Bob would give us trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />We never got to the questions I have from pre-show. So definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />I think that Bob might get in trouble if we keep him much longer. So I&#8217;m trying to not hashtag Bug Bob too much. I&#8217;m still trying. It&#8217;s going to happen. So if you&#8217;re listening to this and you want to help me make Bob smile, just post something with hashtag Bug Bob, and let&#8217;s see if we can get a whole bunch of things in his inbox. Go ahead and tag him in too @BobWP and let&#8217;s have some fun with that. But it&#8217;s really a remarkable thing that you&#8217;ve built so much on the new functionality that&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the block editor, the block bindings API is very new. A lot of these things are cutting edge, and it&#8217;s really cool to see some of that happening. And so I think it would be great to have another conversation at some point in the future. But before we do that, let&#8217;s go ahead and wrap today up. So Ash, where do people go to find you on this collection of tubes we call the internet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />So our company website would be a good place. We&#8217;ve got LightspeedWP Agency, that&#8217;s for more agency-related things, or our product website, which is LSX design on the web. Generally, our social profiles are Lightspeedwp. So if you look at GitHub, YouTube, Twitter, those three are all LightspeedWP and Facebook and Instagram are LightspeedWPdev.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Very cool. And before we close up here, I just generally ask Carl if he has a final question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />We got to save Bob today. We got to save Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I was just excited by the Figma stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />It&#8217;s really neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I lit up at that because I was just like, for me, I think, and probably for a lot of developers and even yourself before you got into it, Figma for me is like, it&#8217;s a designer tool. You do mockups with it, and that&#8217;s about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Well, I&#8217;ve posted two blog posts yesterday. I posted a blog post on announcing the new LSX tour operator design system and our process and a number of things just to explain more about how we got to the end point. And then today I posted a blog post kind of in preparation for this, about our journey from classic to cutting edge. That&#8217;s what I called it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Bob will link those in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Exactly. So there&#8217;s a lot more information there on exactly what you wanted to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Very cool. Yeah, I&#8217;m sure that there will be a lot of people that have an interest in the other things that you&#8217;ve done here. Those blog posts are great resources. That&#8217;s part of what I was going through while I was asking questions here. And we will link some other things to the show notes for this show that we&#8217;ve talked about, things like FacetWP and that new store designer in WooCommerce and some of the other stuff. But yeah, I really appreciate the time you spent to talk with us about your process here. These are always really interesting conversations, and I&#8217;m glad that we were able to dig deep on some of the things. Let&#8217;s talk again in the future here.

Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well, today&#8217;s show, of course, is a special show because there is a huge event just around the corner, and not only do I have wonderful guests here, but this is a very, not the first time, but we have one of our sponsors send somebody here virtually as a guest host, Bernard Meyer. How do you like this? How do you like being a co-host?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />It is my first time and 30 seconds in, it is one of the most amazing experiences of my life. It&#8217;s only going to get better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, so why don&#8217;t you just give a quick intro of who you are because this is really the first time you&#8217;ve been on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />Yeah. So my name is Bernard Meyer. I&#8217;m the Senior Director of Communications and Creative at Omnisend. Omnisend is one of the sponsors for WordCamp US. Actually, WordCamp US will be our one-year anniversary of WordCamps. We just started last year at WordCamp US 2023, so this will be a full-year cycle. We are excited. Each WordCamp has been even better. This will be my first time at WordCamp US, so I&#8217;m expecting amazing things only because of what our CEO and VP of Marketing said about the last WordCamp US. According to what I heard, this is going to be even better. I&#8217;m also a contributor on the marketing team and the media core team and an organizer on the WordCamp Asia communications team. So I&#8217;m deep in there and, yeah, that&#8217;s my short version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Very cool. Now, we have three of the organizers here as we usually do on Do the Woo for the flagship WordCamps. We always love to get that pumped up. We got to start talking about this. Everybody&#8217;s excited. I&#8217;m flying all the way from Portugal. I will say that I still question why they waited until I moved from the Pacific Northwest before putting a WordCamp up there, but I have my suspicions, and that&#8217;s for another entire podcast, so we won&#8217;t get into that part of it. Anyway, we&#8217;re going to have our three guests introduce themselves and we&#8217;re going to dive into WordCamp US. So let&#8217;s start with Katie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Hi all. I&#8217;m Katie Richards. I am one of the four folks on the lead organizing team for WordCamp US this year. This is my first time on the lead team. Last year I was involved with WordCamp US as the lead of the PR and comms team. So naturally this year, I am working with PR and comms, but also with the volunteers and the photography teams, trying to make sure that we have enough folks on the ground to make this event awesome and everyone knows what they need to know to have a successful event. When I&#8217;m not doing WordCamp stuff, I am the project manager of the community growth team at A2 Hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Cool. Julia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />Hello. Well, it&#8217;s a delight to be here and I last met in Taiwan at WordCamp Asia over a really lovely dinner, so it&#8217;s good to see you again, Bernard. My name&#8217;s Julia Golomb and I also am part of the lead four for WordCamp US along with Katie and Aaron who are here, and then Sandy Edwards who&#8217;s not on this recording today. And I am sponsored by Automattic to contribute full-time to the WordPress community team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />All right, and last, but very not least, Aaron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />So I&#8217;m Aaron Campbell. I&#8217;m also on that lead four team for WordCamp US. I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space a long time, probably, I guess, going on almost 20 years now, contributing to the project for maybe 18 of those. I used to contribute mostly through code and now I contribute mostly through things like organizing events like WordCamp US, things like that. When I am not organizing WordCamp US, I am Director of Product at A2 Hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Alright, excellent. Well, let&#8217;s start first with Portland, Oregon. So tell us about Portland, Oregon. I could probably say a few things. I actually lived right between Portland and Seattle for many, many, many, many years. I&#8217;ve been to Portland a few times. Portland. What is special about Portland or what do you want to share about Portland?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />I am happy to start because I love Portland, Oregon. As a city, I make an effort to visit every single year because one of my best friends lives there and there really the nature is what stands out to me. So there are mountains and rivers and the coast. The Pacific Coast is a couple hours west of Portland, but just within the city, you can find hiking and beautiful views and also incredible food. Portland is really well known as a foodie hub and a coffee hub. So everyone who&#8217;s coming to WordCamp US, I encourage you to venture out around Portland to find some great spots for dinner, and I have no doubt that everyone will be having some fabulous coffee while you&#8217;re in town too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />I have to agree with Julia. It&#8217;s a beautiful place. The food and the coffee definitely speak to me, if you will. I love it. I definitely take a little bit more of the kind of pragmatic approach to describing the city in that I feel like it really fits our needs for a conference as well. And it&#8217;s not easy to find a place for a conference like WordCamp US. It&#8217;s not a hundred thousand person conference, but we&#8217;re also pretty big now, and it can be hard to find a place and we bring in a global audience, right? Finding a place that can fit us, that can serve our needs that everybody can travel to easily. It&#8217;s a big ask and Portland really stepped up for us this year. The city itself is helping us in a lot of ways. They put a lot of effort into making sure that conferences can be held at this conference center and interact well with all the hotels and shops and whatnot around. I&#8217;m really excited just that they have been able to pull together this experience for us and for everybody attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Katie, have you ever been to Portland?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I have not. Oregon is the one state on the west coast that I have not been to and I am very excited to check it off my bucket list, but I am excited for this event in Portland for all of the reasons that Julia and Aaron have mentioned, but also knowing that this is the first of two years that we get to be in the same venue, the same location, get to know the city. I think it&#8217;s going to really enhance our experience this year, but also next year as we regather and kind of have a homecoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />I also want to add that the venue where WordCamp US is taking place this year is absolutely gorgeous. It was just renovated in 2019 through a $40 million renovation project. It&#8217;s a super sustainable building. I think maybe I want to say Lead Platinum, which in the US is a certification for building sustainability. So it&#8217;s just a really nice place to be, and I&#8217;m excited to get to spend several days in such a beautiful space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />I had a question. So for WordCamp EU, we did a little music video and we were thinking about doing something at Omnisend for Portland and I grew up in Miami and the furthest north I&#8217;ve been to the west coast, but the furthest north was like San Francisco. So I don&#8217;t know much about Portland except I had two things in my head, nature and coffee. So I&#8217;m happy to know that it&#8217;s a foodie culture as well. But there was one slogan when I was looking at Portland that I was wondering about it&#8217;s Keep Portland Weird. Is that a strong character of Portland or a good description or is that something that&#8217;s minimal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />I think one of the cool ways that I see that coming through in Portland is the push for unique everything. Essentially fewer chains and more unique. So in my experience in Portland, and I maybe have not had as many as some of the others here, but restaurants that you just can&#8217;t find anywhere else, experiences that you can&#8217;t find anywhere else. To me that&#8217;s the weird part of keep it weird. And as someone who loves to experience through their unique food especially, I found that particularly fantastic that you didn&#8217;t have to sort through a million chains that I can already get at my home in Oklahoma. There was plenty of unique stuff there, so I&#8217;m excited for our guests to be able to experience the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />I also want to add that there is a light rail that runs through Portland and so there&#8217;s good public transit to get directly from the airport. You just get on this light rail train and take it from the airport to the venue. The Oregon Convention Center and the official WordCamp US hotel is directly across the street from the venue, and so you can go from your hotel to the airport and vice versa via public transit. I think it&#8217;s, I want to say, a $2 ticket. So people, of course, there&#8217;s rideshare available in Portland and people can use that, but there&#8217;s also the light rail as an option for getting around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />I think keeping it weird, what I love about that is it&#8217;s not only Portland&#8217;s goal, but I think what Aaron said, it&#8217;s a suggestion to everybody visiting. So it&#8217;s like, yeah, be unique and there&#8217;s just little different parts of Portland that you&#8217;ll find uniquely weird in one way or another and how you define weird, that can be something different for everyone, but I think that a lot of WordPressors will fit in well there. So I want to hear more about the actual venue. So let&#8217;s go from Portland, zero in on the venue. You talked a little bit about it, Julia, but there seems to be a lot of buzz around the venue. I&#8217;d love to hear from all three of you what it is that excites you about this venue, even though I don&#8217;t know if any of you have had a chance to visit it, but just from what you&#8217;re doing</p>\n\n\n\n<p>through research and planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />I have not had a chance to visit the venue. I have had the chance to watch some walkthrough videos that some of our folks have put together. There are a number of things that really excite me about this venue, though. My excitement really started to build when our designer, Sam, was pulling together some of the design concepts for our WordCamp US site this year and was just pulling up photos from the venue to use as inspiration and kind of the way that they&#8217;ve brought a lot of that nature feel of the Portland area inside the venue. It was exciting, it was fun, it is going to be a really nice place to be, and then it continued to grow as I saw just how much space we&#8217;re able to get at this venue, something that we have struggled with over the last couple of years, getting enough space that&#8217;s all close together for us to have our talks and our sponsors and all of our people, a couple thousand people all in one, I guess, kind of a cohesive group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this year we have that. I&#8217;m super excited about how much we&#8217;re going to be able to do in the space, how much we&#8217;ve been able to open things up to sponsors to be more creative, more space for them to be and for how we can bring everyone together and not have to have some chunks of our talks or sponsors or whatever really far away from everyone else. We can have lots of space and have it all in one place. And then the last thing that I want to point out that&#8217;s been super exciting is the sustainability of the venue. And Julia brought this up and can probably speak a little bit more to it, but it&#8217;s not just that the venue is sustainable in the way it was built or the way that they operate. They hold us to a sustainability standard as well, and it&#8217;s been really nice having them come alongside us in that and help us figure out how we can have a 2000 person event, have our sponsors still have the impact that they want, and be as good to the environment as we can in the process. So sustainable materials, they&#8217;ve been really good at helping us do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think the thing that I&#8217;m most excited about over last year as far as the venue goes is that the space makes sense for us. We don&#8217;t have to move floors to get to additional conference spaces. Everything is kind of close by. It&#8217;ll be a natural flow in and out of programming rooms. Looking at it from a sponsor&#8217;s perspective, I&#8217;m really excited about what the sponsor hall is going to look like and the interactions we&#8217;re going to be able to have with attendees as they come in and out, which is really fun. I&#8217;m also excited that we haven&#8217;t mentioned this, I think, that the conference hotel for those who have purchased a ticket, it&#8217;s in your confirmation, you can book your hotel room. It&#8217;s right across the street, so as you leave your room in the morning to grab your coffee, you&#8217;re going to run into WordCamp attendees. You&#8217;ll be walking across the street with folks that you&#8217;ll be sitting in sessions with later. Having that sense of closeness gives it more of a summer camp vibe. We&#8217;re going to be eating and hanging out with and just being around all of our WordCamp community friends for several days, and that&#8217;s incredibly exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />So how about if we take this a day at a time? We have four days and I&#8217;ll start with day one, contributor day. So I want to hear not only about contributor day for people that don&#8217;t know what contributor day is and the opportunities for them, but if there is anything unique to this contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />I guess that one&#8217;s on me again because the mentor for the contributor team, this contributor day team this year. First of all, what are contributor days? To me, they&#8217;re a big part of what makes our WordPress project continue forward in a healthy way. We&#8217;re a mostly volunteer-driven project, and people&#8217;s lives ebb and flow for all kinds of reasons. People can contribute heavily at some times and less at other times, but these days give us the chance to really mentor in and bring in new folks to continue that healthy flow of people into our project. And so these days, it&#8217;s not just about the work that gets done on that day, although that&#8217;s great, that&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s great that we get all of our teams together and can make some progress, write some code, write some documentation, whatever it is. But to me, the coolest thing is bringing the people together and the mix of the old folks that have been contributing for a long while and the new folks that have never contributed and get us all in the same space and working together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the coolest, most exciting thing about contributor days for me personally. To that end, what this one&#8217;s going to look like, we have lots of space. Like I said, we have a nice giant hall that we&#8217;re going to be able to have all the contributors in at one time, so that is going to facilitate a lot of that meeting the people that you haven&#8217;t had the chance to meet before, getting to know the people that you&#8217;ve maybe only ever known digitally through their username on Slack, getting that chance to sit across the table from one of them or work together on a project. And so we have plenty of space to do that. And then we have a number of breakout rooms that we&#8217;re going to have available so that smaller groups can go off into a slightly lower noise area to work on something heads down if they really want to for a while. We&#8217;re going to even try to schedule out some of the times for those rooms so that if there are specific projects that teams want to work on and want people from other teams to be able to join them, they&#8217;ll be able to in these breakout rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />I can add that I&#8217;m definitely excited just not to be a sponsor, but to be probably leading the marketing table and just to be a contributor. I love that. It&#8217;ll be my third time leading, but I love that in the beginning there&#8217;s this very small quiet phase on contributor days and then within 15 minutes people start working, there&#8217;s this nice buzz and then they go to lunch and then they come back and then you have this big networking effect where people just crossing tables and they begin to really get into the work and they begin to get into the community. Especially when I look at new contributors, they go from pretty shy before lunch to pretty happy and active and comfortable in the second part. So I&#8217;m pretty excited about that for all WordCamps, I would say definitely for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, for me, I think it&#8217;s sometimes I spend more time often with the community table. I&#8217;ll spend time there or within the community team, but I think this year I&#8217;m going to choose to buzz around, a fly and be the fly on the wall and just listen in because so much for me isn&#8217;t about actually getting my head down and working on things, but I&#8217;d love to hear what&#8217;s going on and there&#8217;s some teams I&#8217;ve never really sat and listened to for a while, so I think that&#8217;s going to be my goal this time around. It sounds like the perfect kind of venue for it and the space for it. So yeah, a lot of great stuff that leads us into the next day. So this is actually different because everything we&#8217;re usually like, okay, contributor day, bam, then we got two days of the event. I would like to hear about the showcase day because this is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />Wednesday, September 18th, is Showcase Day, so it&#8217;s day two of WordCamp US and Showcase Day is something that&#8217;s brand new this year for WordCamp US. The idea is to showcase the most innovative, cutting-edge uses of WordPress. So we&#8217;ll have folks showing off websites that they&#8217;ve developed that use really cool applications of WordPress and not only sites, but also plugins and just anything within the WordPress ecosystem. I&#8217;m super excited about Showcase Day. I think of everything that I&#8217;m psyched about for WordCamp US, which is a lot. Showcase day is the number one, just the caliber or the quality of presentations that we have in store for that day is phenomenal. And I would encourage everyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, you do not want to miss Showcase Day. It&#8217;s the place to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />I was actually going to tell Aaron that I&#8217;m pretty excited about Contributor Day, but I&#8217;m extremely excited about Showcase. It is the number one thing. I have a general rough idea of what&#8217;s going to happen, but I actually don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen. And the way that Julia just mentioned that what they have in store is going to be amazing. I want to be there early just so I can secure a seat in the front and I want to stay there to use the bathroom before I go so I don&#8217;t move because I know that I&#8217;m going to get half the team to come leave the other half walking around and networking. But this is going to be something that we all have on our calendars and we&#8217;re fighting about who&#8217;s going to be able to show up or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />It&#8217;s definitely something that people are going to want to watch for the speaker and talk announcements that are going to be coming out very soon that will cover both the regular classic programming days that you were talking about Bob, as well as this showcase day. There&#8217;s going to be some really exciting stuff. I think that we can probably even talk a little bit to the kind of inspiration that launched this day last year. We had a really fantastic talk by NASA that was showcasing how they were using WordPress to run their site and they did a show-off, this is how we&#8217;re doing it. And then they also did a little bit of behind the scenes, this is how we did the thing. And it seemed like that was an extremely cool way of showing not just the big number that we always hear like, oh, WordPress powers 43% of the internet and it goes from these really big exciting sites down to everybody&#8217;s hobby site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead it really dug into what are some of those, what is WordPress really capable of? What does some</p>\n\n\n\n<p>of that 43% actually look like? And so we thought that worked great, let&#8217;s expand that out. Let&#8217;s give that a whole day. We are doing way more than one cool exciting site. There&#8217;s a ton of amazing stuff happening that&#8217;s powered by WordPress. And so we want to get the chance for the folks that are doing these cutting-edge, exciting, interesting, innovative things with WordPress to show us the sort of wow side of what they&#8217;re doing and then ideally some of them to even come in and show us how we did this amazing thing, but how could you do something similar? And so that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re trying to target this day, have people showing off the wow and then have some people also digging into the how ideally exciting us about WordPress and showing us how we can all level up to do that kind of exciting stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />So we have Contributor Day, Showcase Day, and then we hit the big event for two days. Now I think how I&#8217;d like to take this is there&#8217;s so many pieces that happen during those two days. Let&#8217;s dive into it and I&#8217;d love to hear from all three of you on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I know we say this every year, but one thing that WordCamp US has done consistently well and then better every year is that we&#8217;ve got an incredibly diverse range of speakers and talks for those two programming days. And not only did we build programming days with diversity in mind, but they&#8217;re excellent quality talks. So what we will have available for folks to listen to and interact with is perhaps the best programming that we&#8217;ve put together so far, which is really exciting and something that we try to do year over year is intrude and learn lessons from other WordCamps and take those into account as we start building out our programming. And that was one of the things that I learned fairly quickly on joining the lead team this year is how little I know about what goes into planning WordCamps and how much thought and work goes behind the scenes before a schedule can be announced. So it was really cool to watch come together this year and then be extra proud of the product that&#8217;s coming out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />There are two pieces that I want to highlight from our schedule this year that are different than last year and perhaps previous years. One is that we are weaving showcase day talks throughout the Thursday and Friday programming as well. And so the showcase talks will be, I believe they&#8217;ll be highlighted on the agenda in a different color just so folks know that it&#8217;s a way to have that thread woven not only on Wednesday Showcase day, but also throughout the Thursday and Friday programming. And then we also this year have included a networking hour in the schedule that&#8217;s at the end of the day on Thursday in the sponsor hall. And this is based on feedback that we&#8217;ve heard from WordCamp US attendees about really valuing the networking opportunities that they find at WordCamp US and wanting some more dedicated time to meet other folks who are there, whether that&#8217;s attendees, sponsors, speakers, and get to know them, get to connect with them on a meaningful level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />And if you&#8217;re an introvert, that&#8217;s not something you need to be concerned about. We&#8217;re going to make it as easy as possible for folks who are perhaps a little less comfortable in those situations to find like-minded folks and connect with people who have similar interests and passions within the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />As an outgoing introvert, I really appreciate that. I like to talk to people, but it can be hard to figure out where my people are, I guess so to speak. Where are the people that I can bring value to that conversation or do my part or learn something new and interesting? And so we&#8217;re trying to bring the sponsors in on that a little as well. One of the great things about WordCamps is that our attendees, they&#8217;re really our primary focus. We try to keep things extremely affordable for them to attend to make sure that their experience is amazing. I try not to talk about the money too much. It&#8217;s not what everybody wants to hear about, but every attendee costs us far more than they pay for their ticket to attend, and the sponsors are what make that possible. But not only do our sponsors come to us with the money to make this possible for all these attendees, they also come with often experts from their companies that have a wealth of knowledge to impart to our attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so at times like these networking hours, it gives us the chance to leverage some of those experts and say, hey, if you want to talk about this thing, there are experts at this sponsor booth. Y&#8217;all can go hang out during networking hour and pick their brain, learn from people who are managing thousands or tens of thousands of servers, how to better manage your server. There are those people around and we&#8217;re going to be able to make that available to our attendees during networking hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Bernard, you said this is your one-year anniversary as a sponsor for Omnisend, and to me that&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because it feels like you&#8217;ve been around a lot longer than that and more WordCamps than that. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m thinking, wow, that&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s happened in that period of time. What does WordCamp bring to you as a sponsor and especially hearing all of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />So I have two perspectives, have one as a sponsor and one as a sort of a contributor and a contributing member. So sometimes it&#8217;s a bit hard for me to separate those two, but both of them are related to people. I would say one on the contribution side. So of course there&#8217;s some challenges with contributing to WordPress, but every time you meet people in person, you get this surge of energy when you see like-minded people who are all working together, giving up their free time, sponsored or not, they&#8217;re giving up their time to build this thing, continue pushing it forward, and they put all of their passion into it. And I think that this is the basis for where we as sponsors see value because then you create a community of companies or plugins that also have the similar kind of philosophy. They have the same vibe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re there of course to earn money and to make sales and all that, but they have at the basis it feels like they have this urge to help each other, just whatever it is. So we have a lot of people that we may not find any particular way to work with, but we just want to connect with them and network with them and keep in touch with them and just hope that at some point in the future we&#8217;ll find some business reason to stay in touch. But for the most part, the most valuable thing that we get there is that we network with people who are valuable based on their value, based on their intelligence, based on their passion. And then the business reason comes in a little bit second. And I think the other reason is that Omnisend started more in the Shopify ecosystem and that one, it is very interesting place, but it is pretty different because that one tends to be a bit more transactional, firstly on the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a lot of value placed on the size and scope of your business first and then whatever value you have, secondly. And here, no matter who you are, you can talk to Matt, you can talk to Josepha, you can talk to people who you may not have had any other opportunity to talk with before. And then you can find again places in which you can build that relationship later on. So I think for us from the first time, like I said, when our CEO and VP of marketing just attended WordCamp US, which was last year, they&#8217;ve come back with so much fire and every time we go to the WordCamps events, the flagships or the small ones, we have that fire. It is reignited again and again and again. So I think the value is one that we found one time and it is just continuous and it is always increasing. So it&#8217;s all of us an addiction, I would say everyone is fighting to go to the next WordCamp, and I think the team we&#8217;re sending keeps on getting bigger because everyone just wants to go. That&#8217;s hard to summarize, but I think people, that&#8217;s my word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron:<br />I love that. If we can be that place where it&#8217;s like, hey, come to WordCamp US, get fired up. Be the person that comes back to your team with a million great ideas and a fire behind you. I love that. I hope we&#8217;re that for all kinds of companies and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />I think that anyone who has any doubts or anyone who&#8217;s just a bit curious, the only thing I would say is, as Aaron said, the tickets for WordCamp are pretty cheap. Just go attend the WordCamp, go to the four days or the three days or just the two days, even just one day, just go to contributor showcase day and you will probably catch fire within two or three hours, I think. So any doubters, your doubts will be relieved pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And I think that from someone that has been going to WordCamp since, I think my first one was 2010, and I&#8217;ve gone to various ones over the years. I&#8217;ve spent many years at what I call other conferences where like you said, they&#8217;re very transactional. And I think one of the things people need to remember is that when you walk up to a sponsor at WordCamp, the best thing about that is you&#8217;re not shoved in the face with a product. You actually get to meet the people behind the product. And when I moved into the WordPress space, that was one of the things that stood out most to me was I never felt like I got to really know anybody at a company through a conference because it was that. And you&#8217;re going to get to know people, you&#8217;re going to have good conversations. You&#8217;ll probably meet them later on at a party or you&#8217;ve already met them and you&#8217;re just reconnecting again. So you&#8217;re going to meet people, you&#8217;re going to talk to people, and you&#8217;re going to probably make friends</p>\n\n\n\n<p>. It&#8217;s really valuable. And after all that is done, you go to all these side events, you&#8217;re going to go to breakfast and lunches and dinners and wander around Portland and drink craft beer and coffee and eat food. Then comes the social.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />Yes. I&#8217;m so glad you brought up the social. I was ready to talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />We&#8217;re there now, end of day four, and it is time for the social. Tell us about the social.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />Alright, our four days of WordCamp US conclude on the evening of Friday, September 20th, with the WordCamp US Social, which will be held at OMSI, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. And it&#8217;s a really cool museum on the river with a submarine, an old submarine that is in the river, and attendees can go into the submarine and tour it, which is pretty cool. There&#8217;s a planetarium programming running throughout the event, so people can pop in to see different planetarium films, and there&#8217;s going to be refreshments available. The most important thing to know is that this party, this WordCamp US social, is included with your WordCamp US ticket. Bring your badge. Your badge is your ticket for admission to the social. And if you have a guest with you who&#8217;s in Oregon traveling with you, maybe not attending the daytime programming, just buy them a ticket for WordCamp US. Make sure that you print their badge at the registration desk, and then that&#8217;s their ticket to join you as a plus one at the social. Everyone&#8217;s welcome. It&#8217;s going to be a really, really lovely event and an opportunity to get to relax and meet folks and see old friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Excellent. So we&#8217;re going to wrap up here and I think everybody&#8217;s excited. The thing is, probably people say, Bob, you don&#8217;t sound very exciting, but I&#8217;m holding it all inside me. That&#8217;s how I do my excitement. I never sound super overly excited, and I&#8217;m sure anybody here can attest to that. But yeah, I&#8217;ve got my flight booked, I&#8217;ve got my hotel booked. I will be staying right across the street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />Bob, you&#8217;ve booked your flight, you&#8217;ve booked your hotel. Have you purchased your WordCamp US ticket?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Oh yeah, I did. And did I purchase the last one? That&#8217;s what I want to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />You did not purchase the last ticket. There are still tickets available. If you are listening to this and have not yet purchased your WordCamp US ticket, go to your computer right now and do that. Please get your ticket now. It&#8217;s really helpful for us as we&#8217;re planning to have a clear sense of numbers, and we have tons of space, so everyone who wants to come can, but just make sure you get your ticket as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And we talked about all the great sponsors and I could list them all, but please go to this site, make sure you visit all the sponsors, and if you want to be one of those great sponsors and all of us clamoring up to you, are there any spots left?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yes, there are several spots left, and there is an interest form available on the website as well. So if you are thinking maybe I&#8217;d like to consider sponsoring this year, reach out, have a conversation with our sponsor team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />In particular, we&#8217;ve got a couple of our lowest-cost sponsorship opportunities available for $5,000. You can have a presence in the WordCamp US sponsor hall, which means that a couple thousand people will be visiting your table. And it&#8217;s a great way to have that presence in the sponsor hall. That&#8217;s called the Our Author Level sponsorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Very cool. Well, first of all, I want to thank Bernard for co-hosting and also lending his perspective on the whole thing. Do make sure and visit the Omnisend Booth, find Bernard. Tell him what you thought about him as a co-host and if he should come back again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard:<br />It lived up to the expectations. It was the most fantastic 50 minutes of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Excellent. And thank you three and the entire team. This is huge. It&#8217;s amazing what you pull off. There&#8217;s going to be all these volunteers helping you, and it&#8217;s just your hard work and everything just is, there&#8217;s so much gratitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julia:<br />You mentioned volunteers, Bob. I think we also have a few volunteers&#8217; spots still available. So if somebody is listening to this and moved to contribute to WordCamp US as a volunteer while you&#8217;re actually there, send an email to us at WordCamp.org and let us know that you want to come as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Cool. Well, tons of opportunities. So yeah, go to us.wordcamp.org and the dates are September 17th through 20th. So it&#8217;s coming up real quick. I&#8217;m excited. Please come and say hi to me or find me somewhere. If you&#8217;re one of those volunteers that actually volunteered afterwards, come up and I&#8217;ll take you around and I&#8217;ll introduce you to Bernard because you&#8217;ll love the guy. And I&#8217;m so looking forward to this. And just want to thank all four of you for joining us for this particular episode. And yeah, we&#8217;ll see everybody at WordCamp US. So thank you very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A special thanks to our sponsors who will also be sponsoring WordCampUS.

And we are chatting with the three of the four organizer leads, <strong>Katie Richards, Julia Golomb and Aaron Campbell. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They chat about everything you need to know about WordCamp US, from the host city,  Portland, Oregon, to the innovative Showcase Day, and the various programming and networking opportunities that await attendees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned WordCamp veteran or a first-time participant, this episode is packed with valuable insights and behind-the-scenes details that will get you pumped up for the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights of WordCampUS 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp US Overview</strong>: The upcoming WordCampUS event in Portland, Oregon, promises to be an exciting and memorable occasion. Our discussion highlights the unique aspects and attractions of Portland, including its stunning natural landscapes, vibrant food and coffee culture, and the city&#8217;s quirky charm encapsulated in the slogan &#8220;Keep Portland Weird.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Venue Details</strong>: The venue for WordCampUS is the Oregon Convention Center, which has recently undergone a $40 million renovation project. This sustainable building, certified with LEED Platinum, offers a beautiful and eco-friendly space for the event. Its convenient location includes a light rail connection from the airport and is directly across the street from the official WordCamp US hotel, enhancing accessibility and attendee experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Event</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Day 1: Contributor Day</strong>:<br />Contributor Day is important for mentoring and onboarding new contributors to the WordPress project. It offers extensive networking and collaboration opportunities in a large, cohesive space with dedicated breakout rooms for focused work. This day is about more than just the work accomplished; it&#8217;s about building connections and fostering the WordPress community spirit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Day 2: Showcase Day</strong>:<br />A new addition this year, Showcase Day is designed to highlight the most innovative and cutting-edge uses of WordPress.

Unlike other transactional conferences, WordCampUS allows sponsors and attendees to connect on a personal level, building relationships that go beyond mere business interactions. This sense of community and shared passion is what makes WordCampUS special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp US Social</strong>: The event will conclude with a social gathering at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) on the evening of Friday, September 20th.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 18.9, a little bit of block themes, WooCommerce, and more. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My special guest today is the wonderful Ellen Bauer, early adopter of blocks and block themes with themes from ElmaStudio, from New Zealand, temporarily from Bangkok, Thailand. Thank you so much for joining me today. How are you, Ellen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer: </em>Thank you very much. I&#8217;m happy to be here. Yes, I&#8217;m in Bangkok right now, so I&#8217;m very good. Thank you. How are you, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Munich&#8217;s getting really summer temperatures, so we&#8217;re 33 degrees already early in the morning. Well, not that early, but it&#8217;s really hot. And with apartments without air conditioning, we have fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Oh, that is great. I think that&#8217;s even hotter than Bangkok right now because here it&#8217;s the rainy season, so it&#8217;s coolish for Bangkok terms, maybe 29 or 30 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Quite nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s probably humid too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> It is. It is, yeah. But compared to two months ago, it&#8217;s actually really nice. So yeah, we are enjoying it. Another two weeks, then we will be back in New Zealand. Winter in New Zealand. So a change is coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you need some warm clothes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, I already ordered fleece sweaters. That will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So since we last talked, and it&#8217;s probably&#8230; Well, you and I met at WordCamp Europe, but since you were last on the Changelog, your responsibilities have changed quite a bit in the last few weeks. So what are you working on right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, that is true. Changed a lot. So just after WordCamp Europe in Turin, I started as a product manager for WooCommerce, with Automattic now, which is very exciting and it&#8217;s a great responsibility and opportunity for me that I&#8217;m very excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And everyone has been welcoming me so nicely and I&#8217;m still in the onboarding phase and it&#8217;s really, really fun at the moment and lots to do and I have lots of ideas too. My main responsibility is trying to increase block theme adoption for WooCommerce and there&#8217;s a lot to do still. So lots of work and lots of fun working on that. I&#8217;m really, really grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, just from my personal opinion, I think I couldn&#8217;t have chosen a better person to do all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;m really happy that you&#8217;re my coworker and that you&#8217;re working on the WooCommerce things. So things are moving in the WordPress space. There are quite a few things happening and you can all learn about these other things on the other podcasts like Do the Woo, I don&#8217;t know. If you haven&#8217;t tuned into those podcasts, there are about 12 different shows with, I think, 20 different hosts, so that&#8217;s definitely something to look about, dear listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also a WP Minute with Matt Medeiros. He has some great shows and commentary on the news in WordPress and here we stick to Gutenberg and what&#8217;s around blocks development and block themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first announcement today is the videos for the Intermediate Theme Developer course on the Learning pathways on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the training team has been working on learning pathways for beginner, intermediate, and advanced and then build courses around it. So you could start with the beginner developer course and then go to the intermediate theme developer and then to the advanced. And all those courses or lessons in those courses are actually self-contained, so you could just pick and choose which one you want to learn about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the intermediate theme developer course, there are 32 videos and it&#8217;s covering everything from global styles and theme JSON template, template parts, patterns, style variations, block styles, you name it, what&#8217;s in block themes, but the course is also built around&#8230; It covers all also classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for instance, the Loop or how to use the theme JSON in classic themes. So if you need some refresher on certain concepts, you definitely can watch them individually or use the course on <a href=\"http://learn.wordpress.org\">learn.wordpress.org</a> to get it in sequence. I also will share the link to the beginner WordPress developer course, which has been published also a couple of weeks ago. Just want to remind you that that is there. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: We also have upcoming developer hours and I think that&#8217;s a really exciting topic for block developers on August 13, 3:00 PM UTC with the title Developer Hours, Hello Blocks and Introduction to Block Development. I think that&#8217;s a super interesting topic for everyone who hasn&#8217;t built blocks or just wants to get a refresher or update on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blocks are used now with almost all WordPress projects and core blocks cover quite a wide range of things that you can do with them. You also have a lot of third-party block libraries available, but sometimes it&#8217;s just not enough and you need to build your own blog. I&#8217;ve been there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you definitely have been there, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s really a lesson learned to try to build your own block and it&#8217;s actually way easier, I felt, for most cases, for most custom blocks compared to what I initially thought. And so we&#8217;ve come up a long way and you can learn in this developer hours how to build your own custom block from scratch, which is really cool. So there&#8217;s a meet up link for that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, just a couple of weeks ago, there was the developer hours. Do you really need a custom block? What are the alternatives to building custom blocks? So you decide it. Block styles are not enough. Block variations are not enough. Patterns with sync patterns, all rights are not enough. You need your own custom block because the core block doesn&#8217;t give you enough features or anything, but then you need to start from scratch. And if you haven&#8217;t started yet, this definitely gets you an in into the topic and the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two days later, there will be a hallway hangout with Anne McCarthy and it&#8217;s about let&#8217;s chat about what&#8217;s next in Gutenberg. With WordPress 6.6 being out, the teams are already working feverishly on what they want to put into WordPress 6.7 and Anne McCarthy wrote about this one Hangout seeks to be another snapshot of what&#8217;s being worked on Gutenberg plugin to provide a broader awareness to more WordPress contributors and get feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hope is to come together early to talk about different features, flush out concerns sooner, and help more folks get involved and find ways to work better together. I know that there are quite a few things in the roadmap for 6.7. The official roadmap hasn&#8217;t been published yet, but watch out. I think after that hallway hangout, we will find something on the make blog. Are you excited about 6.7?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yes, and I will definitely try to make that hallway hangout. I think I will be just, I think the first time back in New Zealand, so I hope I&#8217;m not too jet-lagged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that&#8217;s really exciting, and I appreciate Anne&#8217;s work of giving us an overview of things that are happening with her source of truth for the releases, they&#8217;re just amazing and so helpful for everyone who is busy and can&#8217;t catch up with everything happening because that&#8217;s happening so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I joined the last hallway hangout on what gave us a glimpse into the future and also being able to be shaping that future. So I hope lots of people can join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I forgot to tell anybody when it&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s going to be August 15th at 15:00 UTC, 3:00 PM UTC and I also share the announcement for that hangout in the show notes because it also lists what parts of the content of it, and it&#8217;s about data views of course, and it&#8217;s about sync patterns, it&#8217;s about canonical block examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion hasn&#8217;t ended yet what a canonical plugin will be, but people are working on additional blocks for core, then gallery block grid layout, and then the Zoom out view definitely. And together with the advanced content only editing, those will be topics of that hangout and see the first iterations or discussions or heated discussions about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, I think also for WooCommerce, the concept of canonical blocks and having some of them, maybe for Woo blocks as well is really interesting and could help just filling some gaps that are there currently for block theme builders and just everyone working with blocks trying to build e-commerce sites. So yeah, that&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s one more announcement, which another developer hour and with the title, Building WordPress Themes With Create Block Theme Plugin, the create block theme plugin, which I think is so exciting and it&#8217;s happening on August 27 at 3:00 PM UTC and with Tammie Lister and you, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yes, I really love the create block theme plugin and I get lots of questions from our team users or agency users, how they can use it to maybe create child themes or create new themes that are block themes easily. So I think that&#8217;s really exciting for small site builders and agencies to work with that plugin and learn about it more in the developer hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the topics that you two will cover, and it sounds like a lovely learning session, is you will cover how to create a theme with a plugin from scratch, how to clone an existing block theme or create a child theme. That&#8217;s one of the questions I think I have a lot from people who have been working more with classic themes is do I even need a child theme? How do I create one from a block theme? How does it all work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s still a new concept for many people, so that will be super useful. Then how to customize your theme in the site editor is also very good, I feel, because there&#8217;s still some confusion of what the site editor is actually doing, how to use it. So I think that will be so helpful for people, how media is used in templates and how you can manage media, how the plugin helps make themes, translation ready, that&#8217;s also one of the questions I have from people. That is all really, really helpful content that you will cover in that developer hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, the create block theme bridges the gap. We have three different design tools. One is coming through theme JSON, first is core and then there is the theme JSON from the theme, and then there are user changes in the site editor and they all come together on the site through the black box, I call the site the style engine. But the user changes, they all end up in the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for a theme developer, if you want to grade the theme that you reuse someplace else, you need to get that out of the database into your theme JSON and that&#8217;s what this create block theme plugin is actually doing and then a lot of things around it. So you can export whatever you do in the site editor or your client is doing in the site editor, you can all then harvest that and put it back into the theme to maybe use on other sites or put it into version control or just have it on a test site or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So create block theme. So August 27th, 3:00 PM UTC, 15:00 UTC is definitely a place if you&#8217;re interested in that particular topic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to also point our listeners, dear listeners to our developer blog because we have two new posts that might be interesting to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damon Cook, he&#8217;s a developer relations manager or developer relations person from WP Engine. He published on the developer block building a card layout with a hover reveal effect, meaning in the short tutorial you learn how to add a block style to a core block. That&#8217;s always a great skill to have and then add additional CSS for animation. And it&#8217;s even interesting for content creators, you learn how to create a grid block with card style cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just reviewed it and tested the code and it&#8217;s a real neat example on what is possible with the block editor. Even if the core doesn&#8217;t provide you within all the features like the animation, you could still add it in CSS in a block style. And similar to that is Justin Tadlock&#8217;s new post on the developer block, it&#8217;s mixing and matching styles, colors, and typography in WordPress 6.6, and he teaches us how to create custom color and topography only global style variations now with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So universe is expanding exponentially with all the style variations and where you can do section styles and then just offer different variations for certain sections. It&#8217;s really neat. There was also a hallway hangout where we kind of discussed that all previously, so I will share that link as well in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I love just the&#8230; It&#8217;s an easy concept with the style variations and styles really get a lift different look on the front end. I really love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s not only on the front end, you also get it into the editor if you do it right. It puts it into the editor. So I did some basic, basic testings and I was able to just put in the JSON notation. You can just put a style variation in the styles&#8217; directory on your theme and it pulls it automatically in. You don&#8217;t have to worry about PHP or registering your CSS separately from editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all comes in right away and it also uses those things in front end as well as in block editor and it&#8217;s just fabulous. There is some nice magic going on. I haven&#8217;t finished my post yet, but I&#8217;m going to write on the Gutenberg times about it, how to easy put a frame around your images and all that or different kind of frames or shadows and all that, how to just add it to a style and then grab it in the theme or WordPress grabs it from your styles&#8217; directory in the theme, so it&#8217;s really magic. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> That is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 18.9</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> So yeah, let&#8217;s talk about the Gutenberg release 18.9. That&#8217;s really cool that it&#8217;s like 18 releases. Really, really great. So with this release, there were 245 PRs merged by 59 contributors and the release contains 84 enhancements and 72 bug fixes. That&#8217;s a lot of work. Really, really beautiful to see that coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, don&#8217;t worry, we are not talking about every single one of them. Otherwise, we would be here another two and a half hours or three, but no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> We&#8217;re wrapping it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, we&#8217;re wrapping it together. So the biggest changes are in the block library. That was more a quality of life changes that they added examples to the preview and previews to the blocks. There were a few blocks where you have them and then there are quite a few blocks where you don&#8217;t have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they started to work in 18.8 And then 18.9 They continue it and now there are examples for the post author block, the post date block, we don&#8217;t call them that anymore. It&#8217;s the author block, the date block, the featured image block and the terms block when you have them in the insert. In code, they still have the prefix of post, but that prefix went away. But that&#8217;s definitely a quality of life change. So it makes the mystery, takes the mystery out of it. What is this kind of block? What does it do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> It&#8217;s very helpful. Then the query loop block got enhancements too. So the post list variation was removed, the convert, the post content type setting to a toggle group control. If there were a few items, then query loop changed the default query loop variations and set query loop to have the inherent value by default. Then I think the SoundCloud icon got updated in the social links block. Oh, that&#8217;s another block. No worries. Not in the query loop block anymore, but it also got an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the icon was actually updated. On the query loop there, they have the inherent value by default is something that, I don&#8217;t know, it was a 50/50 chance that people get confused about it, what it does and it was not by default. Switched on so when you do the categories or so, it takes the inherent value from the query parameters, from the link where it came from, and sometimes that people get confused when they built their own query loops on pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> It actually confused me quite a lot in the beginning. I remember that and I never quite knew should I have it toggled on or off and I always had to test it out. I remember that got me always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and now you get confused the other way because they changed it around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I feel. Yeah, probably. I always had to test it. I was like, why is it not working how I wanted it to work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It wasn&#8217;t intuitive and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s more intuitive now, but we will find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> It&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I&#8217;ll test it again too. I haven&#8217;t tested it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>And dear listeners, everything here is for testing. Test it out and chime in. And I&#8217;m just going to do a little side note here. On the WordPress Slack there is an outreach channel where we can discuss those confusing things. So if you are not quite sure how it&#8217;s supposed to work, come into the channel, discuss it with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are quite a few theme developers in there and we have about 800 people in the channel. Not all of them, most of them are lookers of course, like in any community. But there&#8217;s always somebody there who can help out and it&#8217;s quite a nice bunch and we have all been there that we tried to figure things out and needed help figuring it out. So it was coming into the outreach channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as for the enhancement, there&#8217;s enhancements on the components, quite a few, but I wanted to just point out the tabs component is getting quite some attention now because it&#8217;s one of the components that you could add to, that is needed for the data views or for the admin as well as for content creators. So they&#8217;re building that component so you can add into your custom blocks if there&#8217;s a need for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also is used actually in the sidebar when you have the settings and the styles tabs in the sidebar from a block that&#8217;s also using the tabs component and there are quite a few changes there. So check them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> And for the design tools, I think border blocks support got added to quite a few blocks. The term description block, the media text block, gallery block, border block support, the social links, paragraph quote and heading got border support or is it inherited from outer blocks? I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure, maybe you can help me out there, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inherited. It&#8217;s block intern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Just edit directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Directly. So if you put a paragraph in your canvas, you get in the style section, you get the border controls like radius and color and thickness and style and there was for WordPress 6.6, I published a post with the roster of which design tools are available for which block because there are quite a few holes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I&#8217;m surprised that it isn&#8217;t. I thought that heading and things had the border control already. It&#8217;s such a useful little support that can be almost on every call block, I feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Right. But it needs to have a few iterations before it gets rolled out to all the blocks to make sure that it&#8217;s actually feasible and workable. And until then, it was only on the group block and on the pull quote and on the columns I think and images. So there were quite a few that had it and now they&#8217;re actually going through the list on Adam and whichever block can actually be using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> So there are quite a few that it gets added to, which I think is useful. I remember when I built my own blocks, I always used to try to add it to the blocks because they&#8217;re just a useful little snippet and can be used in creative ways and be helpful at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think sometimes I use just the bottom border to create a line below something or above something. So yeah, you can be quite creative with to use. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s supposed to be used that way, maybe I&#8217;m getting people into wrong&#8230; Giving them wrong ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, the tools are there to just have a border on the bottom of things or yeah, I sometimes used it not with the block editor, but when I was building sites and doing some CSS there, I was only just using the right side at the bottom to mimic a drop shadow without having to use the drop shadow and it&#8217;s all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a radius there, you can have a border color changes thickness also the different types. So they&#8217;re solid, their started line and all that. That&#8217;s all available now to all those blocks. And one of them is actually also the buttons block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can have border now, you always could have a border around the single button but not around the whole button set if you have two or three or more buttons in a row. So that is really cool too. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> What else do we have in here? I think an update on data views, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well there&#8217;s more support coming on. So the latest comment got color support and then the buttons got padding border and color and the image got margin support that I was surprised that it didn&#8217;t have it, but it obviously didn&#8217;t have it before. And then the code book also got spacing support. So I have to rebuild the blog post that I did on the make blog about the roster and which design tools are supported by which block for the next version definitely as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So data views, there is now a reordering of the columns possible, so when you see your pages in a list, you can change the order of the columns and possibly also switch it off. It also now has support for the filters, you can combine fields to filter things. And it also now gives you an updated front page badge in your pages where the page that is the front page is going to be identified differently. So with a nice icon, so that&#8217;s the data views. Data views are just the admin pages for themes, for templates, pages and patterns in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, I really love that update. I think it just brings this modern feel into WordPress. I think we have been looking at the tables for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, right. And I&#8217;m glad that they&#8217;re doing it for the site editor separately from the WP admin just so it works out nicely, but it actually is another point of friction for new users where they see the, it&#8217;s not a consistent admin thing, it of gives a little bit of a confusion what is in which place, where do I go from things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that from WordPress.com and they had Calypso, but that&#8217;s a temporary thing, of course. And I know that some of the contributors already working on getting the list of posts into the data and the new data views, but it needs to be done very carefully because there are quite a few extensibility features beforehand and the backwards compatibility with plugins and all, because for 10 years pretty much, plugins were the ones who actually fixed some of the old UI in WordPress and every plugin did it a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to make sure that all the contributors all want to make sure that all this backwards compatibility is not going to blow up some pages there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Very exciting work, I feel. So another update has been to the locking of blocks, I think UI update. So they tweaked the&#8230; I think just edit some spacing and change the button size of the block logging modal. So I think it just has a little bit more spacing and is easier to read and update. That was also in the latest release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yes. Sometimes these little tweaks actually help a lot, contributing to the consistency and to take out the mystery and make the user brain feel comfortable where they are and not get confused just because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, definitely so much. Small changes can make a big difference. It&#8217;s really amazing too to see that. And I feel like think mainly it&#8217;s the spacing added and the button size. It does look a little bit cleaner and better to understand for our brains. So I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then there&#8217;s one new API that, well it&#8217;s not new, but the block bindings API received some unification from get value and get values on the functions there that you have get value, set value, set values and get values, that&#8217;s certainly for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting to make sure that your block binding still work with this and have some additional, there&#8217;s no additional features in there. I think just that it&#8217;s a developer experience enhancement, so it makes it a little bit easier to work with the block binding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> All right. So I think then we move on to experiments or did I skip something? I&#8217;m just wondering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> There&#8217;s a long list of&#8230; So yeah, in the experiments I think it&#8217;s all about the grid. Am I right? And you maybe, Birgit, need to help me out a little bit here getting the listeners up to date because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to properly test it myself. I will do that definitely. But I think it&#8217;s just fine-tuning and some things have been disabled. So maybe help me out, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, I do. So it&#8217;s just one of the experiments that is there is the interactive grid layout and there have been quite a few changes there or updates that we want to point out. One is the block movers, the handles have changed and it&#8217;s probably easier to move now blocks from one grid cell to the other, which you probably want to do anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also adding a block to the grid block was, I tested it and it confused me a bit and I was not alone was that I would have hoped that the plus sign for the inserter would be in the grid cell, but it was on the outside of the grid block and it wouldn&#8217;t help. It was tricky to get a new block into a full grid block. So that has changed. You definitely need to switch on the experiments though to figure that out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> So it&#8217;s just if you have, I think under Gutenberg experiments, and I think this is grid interactivity is the name that you have to switch on, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, exactly, exactly. And then the other part is that there&#8217;s a visualizer popover and they also confuse people how to use it and they hide it now under the canvas, so it&#8217;s hidden away. So for the manual grids, they disable some of the inserter in between inserters and they also don&#8217;t display the default appender for the manual grid, but it&#8217;s really a work in progress and it definitely needs some more testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> It is, and it&#8217;s quite complicated to make it very user-friendly, but a great tool to have. So that&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it is. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Working with grids, finally. I remember that was one of the first more complex blocks that I will build was I want to have grid layout and actually some of the things that are now in core look quite similar to what I have done, which is cool to see that it&#8217;s very different, of course, easier to use in complex, but the core with rows and how you can snap them into multiple columns, it&#8217;s quite similar, which is cool. And you guys come into core, I&#8217;m so happy about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, I like the core span and rose span for each cell that you can move it around. It&#8217;s really interesting. You can get some nice layouts that are called bento layouts, like the bento boxes from Japanese cuisines. You can build your own website as a bento box. That&#8217;s really cool. Or if you so prefer, you can actually build a Pied Mondrian design with just squares and rectangles, which I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, grid changes the layout options so much. I love it. It&#8217;s incredible. It&#8217;s crazy that we didn&#8217;t have it for such a long time and we had to just stack everything below each other in a long, one column thing. It&#8217;s so much more creative and I think it gives just a lot of flexibility to layout building for users. So it&#8217;s really exciting to have that as a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Definitely. It was in WordPress core since 6.2 for CSS or for theme builders, for developers, but there wasn&#8217;t any interface for that. And I&#8217;m really happy that we now have an interface, but that is also where the complication comes in because some of the concepts are really hard for somebody who doesn&#8217;t have any knowledge about how grid layout is supposed to work, it&#8217;s really hard to convey the concepts with the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re taking it slow, but I&#8217;m also glad that they&#8217;re taking it one step at a time and get people into how to use that. They&#8217;re quite great theme developers that show people what they can do with it and I mentioned before, Damon Cook&#8217;s article for the developer blog has some nice instructions on how to create a card layout with the grid block and with the stack block and combining all those great tools. It&#8217;s really interesting what can happen there. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, it changes a lot. I also like that we work slowly on it because it&#8217;s really complex and like you said, could confuse users because it&#8217;s quite hard to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So there were quite a few updates to the documentation and I almost like to call them out because one of the big hurdles for developers getting into block development and block themes is the leaky documentation that not everything is documented well enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the contributors updated the documentation for the interactivity API on how to install and import the interactivity API to a block. And then also the alpine versus preact extra explanations. Those are libraries on which the interactivity API is based on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having some of that explanation in the documentation probably dissolved some of the mystery as well. And then the GetContext function received an update on the usage examples in conjunction with the namespace argument. And then there were a few other updates as well. All right. What else is in there? Was that it? That was it for the Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I think that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Gutenberg 18.9 of course there were, I think we talked about maybe 45 of the 245 PRs that landed in there. Definitely consult the Changelog from the release post that that came out. And I will share in the show notes when this podcast is published.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development and Discusssed<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we come to the section what&#8217;s in active development or discussed, and I wanted to point out all the plugin developers around you or around me here amongst the listeners to a PR that&#8217;s 61577 on the Gutenberg report that is the first iteration on a plugin template registration API for plugins. It has been really hard for plugins to, say you offer a custom post type for books or recipes or something like that, how can add a template for the block that goes into the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a big hurdle there. With a new PR, there will be new functions and new class. So there will be a WP_register_template function and there will be a WP_block_templates registry class. And they&#8217;re all based on register block type, but they actually go into the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you follow the PR, you also see some code examples that you can use first for testing and also for learning about this API and how it&#8217;s going to work. Right now it&#8217;s not yet merged, but it&#8217;s getting ready to be merged and I hope it&#8217;s going to be in 19.0, latest 19.1. But if you want to test it yourself, you need to get through some hoops there. You would need to fork Gutenberg, then check out the branch for the PR run NPM install. So we get all the NPM updates right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can follow those testing instructions if you add the plug in to a local or a local WP site install. So you can link that. But yeah, it&#8217;s definitely for developers, your content creators and no code site builders, need to shut your ears a bit. It&#8217;s going to be a little technical there, but I just wanted to point that out because it would be really helpful to have early tests in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also wait until it&#8217;s merged and then grab either the release or grab the Gutenberg Nightly to test it and use those examples that are in the PR for your testing. I&#8217;m sure there will be an announcement for call for testing in the outreach channel and probably on the make blog as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is the first time you hear about it. And then I&#8217;m wondering when the next time of the Gutenberg Changelog will be. And Ellen, you&#8217;re probably happy to know that the developer who contributes to Core is actually coming from WooCommerce who had some trouble implementing block templates for a plugin or major plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WooCommerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s really cool to see now that I see a lot of the behind the scenes things happening that&#8217;s really an effort to contribute work across all these multiple instances at Automatic. I really love to see that and I think there&#8217;s an effort to do more of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really exciting to see that WooCommerce could contribute something to Core and I would also hope that with the block themes that we&#8230; Or the adoption of block themes to push that I will be able to do that to contribute to core with things we feel needed as in WooCommerce. I think there&#8217;s a lot to do there, which is exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you plan, you are the trailblazer there for adoption of block themes on the extension sites. So that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;re coming to the end of our show. This was a little shorter than usual. Don&#8217;t fear. We&#8217;ll come back end of August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: With more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> With more and covering two plugin releases, 19.0, 19.1. We will record a show in the last week of August because I will go on vacation and it&#8217;s a two-week vacation. And then with this week and the next week, jumbling, it&#8217;s going to be a four-week hiatus for the podcast as well as for the weekend edition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer: </em>Well-deserved rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer: </em>It&#8217;s quite active. It sounds like an active holiday, so maybe not rest, but just a change of scenery is always good to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s a change of scenery, but we don&#8217;t have a whole lot of daily activities. We are going to British Columbia and it&#8217;s all about landscape, it&#8217;s about water, it&#8217;s about boating, and it&#8217;s about just sitting there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, outdoors and do some hikes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Indeed. So Ellen, thank you so much for joining us again here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, if people want to connect with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I remember the last one I did was also a two version of it. I was like, oh my goodness, this is a lot. So I hope I did a little better this time. I hope you want to have me back at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You can&#8217;t do badly. I know you Ellen, you&#8217;re one of the well-prepared co-hosts here on the show, so don&#8217;t you worry about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> We&#8217;ll see if you invite me back at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>I can put it on a calendar, but I don&#8217;t want to scare you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> No, I&#8217;d love to, actually. It&#8217;s really helpful for me to stay up to date with things. I love that. Really good for me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: All right, so if people want to connect with you and in your new role, where would they reach you? Are you on the WooCommerce Slack or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I&#8217;m on the WooCommerce community Slack. I am on the WordPress Slack and on Twitter, quite active. Instagram, YouTube, you can find me anywhere if you Google Ellen Bauer. So yeah, I&#8217;m around and I love to connect. I think one of the things I really feel is important and that I can contribute to help WooCommerce too, is that I really want to be available to everyone building block themes for e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really one of the third things is that I want to collect the feedback and the pain points. And I know because I&#8217;ve built a WooCommerce block theme myself that there are a lot of pain points still. There&#8217;s a lot of improvements have made and it&#8217;s just very complicated work. So we have to be patient and we have to just speak up and engage and just work together on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really big, big topic to make this work. So I&#8217;m around. And one of the things I&#8217;m also planning, I haven&#8217;t announced it yet, but I will within the next one or two weeks, is that I also plan, because I am so inspired by Anne&#8217;s work doing the hallway hangouts and was so good for me to have this little community to voice the issues just in a casual way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I want to create a little community hangout, Zoom hangout around WooBlock themes. So I think that will be good to get out there and then people can join in and I will have different topics and just have it very casually. So I will announce that very soon just everywhere I can so people can get aware of it. So here I am saying it to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You heard it here first, dear listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Actually, it&#8217;s the first time because I&#8217;m still getting on board and there&#8217;s lots to do. But I think that is important to get established early, like a monthly little hangout to be available because that&#8217;s one of the main goals I have is just to be available for people who try to build with WooCommerce and just really, really important to hear everyone out and just be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s terrific.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> So just ping me with any questions you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s terrific. I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;re picking up on that. There&#8217;s also a roadmap rollout post from Beau Levens, I think, where WooCommerce is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer: </em>That&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I will also share the link to the WooCommerce community Slack in the show notes. And well, if you&#8217;re announcing this out and the next weekend edition comes out, it&#8217;s going to be in there. But that will come out at the end of August as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> And I think the WooCommerce developer blog really is way more exciting now. They do great work there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. The developer relations, Stephanie Pai. Natalie, I think is her name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer: </em>Jacqueline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, Jacqueline. Yeah. Why do I think Natalie? There must be somebody&#8230; Jacqueline, yeah. They really connected with the community through&#8230; I saw it at WordCamp Europe when they connected with the community and talked with a few plugin developers and also in WordCamp, Asia. All right, before we end…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Wrap it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wrap it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Not yet. I want to get you on vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: As always, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com/podcast and this is number 105.

Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Courtney:<br />How are you, Robert? How&#8217;s your summer going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s still summer? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s been so hot. We were just talking about that in the green room, how the temperature&#8217;s been nuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes, yes, yes. Robert and I, being in America, our weather has been very weird. I&#8217;ve been having a lot of Florida weather here in South Central Pennsylvania, which I would like to send back to Florida and now that would be delightful. But the weather in Europe was pretty cool at WordCamp Europe. I liked that temperature better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Everything is cool when you&#8217;re in Torino.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />This is true. So today we&#8217;re going to get into a little bit of some of the talks that we saw at WordCamp Europe, some of the other open-source connections that were made during this event, and a little bit of pulse on the community as to what we&#8217;ve seen going on in open source. Most recently we&#8217;re just on the heels at the time of this recording of seeing WordPress 6.6.1 ship, which is great. But that said, Robert, how did you spend your WordCamp Europe and what stood out most to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Wow, attendance. I mean, I&#8217;m just going to go with that. So WordCamp Europe was talk, talk, talk, work, work, work, network, network, network.<br />We had a booth there for Botguard and had to do some of that. But yeah, it always amazes me how full of people WordCamp Europe is and it was really great to see some of, even I&#8217;ll call &#8217;em micro-communities, get together. I know there was a large contingent from Serbia that was doing their thing, and then you&#8217;d have folks from the Netherlands and Germany and getting that face time that they may not get during the rest of the year. So it&#8217;s always the people and the networking and energy that leaves me smiling for at least six months. Hoarse completely, but definitely smiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I saw that there was also a sub-community of the Jonathans getting photos together. Were there any photos of the Roberts? Because I think you and Mr. Dunn here could both be in that photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And Robert Windisch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yeah, see, I was just hanging out with him in Canada the other week. That&#8217;s right. Yeah, the Roberts need to do a photo. I&#8217;m going to petition for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And we will also include Robbie Adair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes, yes, absolutely. Include all those that have Rob, Bob or some variation of that related to their names for sure. So WordCamp Europe kicked off with a really amazing talk. We heard first as our opening keynote at WordCamp Europe about the sustainability of open source being the future, and this was something that was shared by both Joost and Juliet who gave a presentation on this. Joost, of course, being the founder of a very well-known SEO plugin company, and Juliet is really well-known in the PHP space, but not a lot of people in WordPress outside of those that pay attention to PHP know Juliet yet. Juliet is an amazing, amazing woman, very talented dev, and somebody that I got to know during Europe quite a lot. And so during that time that she and Joost gave that presentation, they were sharing a great deal about how much of what we use or do on a daily basis depends on open source and how people are often unaware of that implication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been eye-opening to me, not just from their talk, but also over the last couple of years as I tune into the automotive industry using a lot of open-source technology. Of course, I work for a web host and I know that our servers use a lot of open-source technology to power the hosting environments as well, but there&#8217;s a lot more to open source to learn about that I think we don&#8217;t often see. So they were sharing some of the use cases of that, but they were also really great at helping shed light on. Open source is never free, so you&#8217;ve got either funding to pay people or the time that people give up for their families and their jobs and these other things to make open source possible. So I thought that they really landed that conversation fantastically well, and it&#8217;s something that I believe that the WordPress community especially needs to tune in on. You haven&#8217;t gotten a chance yet, go watch the replay on that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, I think hopefully Bob can drop that into the transcript of the actual link. Yeah, free and open source are always fun words to mess up. And yes, the code may be freely accessible, but how do you put it together? Who&#8217;s put that together? Coming from the Joomla community, which is a hundred percent volunteer where there is no corporate support in any way, shape or form, the burnout is extreme because you just can&#8217;t do that all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yeah, knowing what I do of Juliet, I feel fine in sharing this. Just a few months back, about half a year, maybe a little bit longer ago now, we saw PHPCS, which is the PHP coding standards. Juliet is unarguably the lead dev on this. There are several other contributors to this. That project sat in an abandoned repo and abandoned being that there was a company that created this as an open-source project. The company shuttered and Juliet did not have administrative rights over that area and nobody that did was still contributing. Juliet has been funded through contract work as have others to that area, but it was not at a sustainable level for the amount of contribution needed for that. And I highlight it because WordPress uses WPCS, the WordPress coding standards, and those areas in particular also need to depend upon the PHPCS. So it&#8217;s just a set of rules basically that make sure that how we&#8217;re writing not just our PHP, but I believe it also applies to HTML and CSS, that these things adhere to specific standards so that we have some security reliability in all of the code that we&#8217;re deploying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any one of those areas were to fail, that could jeopardize not just WordPress, but also at PHPCS, it would impact many other open-source projects and some that are not, that depend upon PHPCS. And then within WordPress, not only does it impact core, but WPCS that depends on PHPCS also impacts many plugins. Hosts use it as part of securing their environments for managed environments for customers. So there was a lot really dependent on that, and Juliet&#8217;s just been through quite a lot in the past year securing the funding needed, not just for herself, but also the couple of other devs that are working on this. And it&#8217;s one of those backbones of the internet, so I can&#8217;t say enough about the work that she&#8217;s doing. And also, Joost wrote a fantastic piece that helped get at least my executives to participate in funding the work inside of PHPCS as well to make sure that our customers are really well protected. So please do tune in, watch, see what&#8217;s going on. Even if you don&#8217;t really understand code, not the point, it&#8217;s knowing that it&#8217;s securing you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Well, it&#8217;s to your point about validating the stuff that WordPress utilizes from plugins to things to Gutenberg to all that. Of course, my favorite is having the tabs versus spaces argument, so that&#8217;s something else as well. But for those who are not technical, just think of tabs versus spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I just got into the conversation at WordCamp Canada about pineapple and pizza. Now you&#8217;re bringing up tabs versus spaces. We&#8217;re going to start a riot with the devs. They&#8217;re all groaning at us right now, Robert. I can hear them. So in addition to that, there were a couple of other really cool things that took place during WordCamp Europe. One of the first things was that right after Joost and Juliet&#8217;s presentation during the Q&amp;A, I asked a question, and then out of that came meeting Matthias from Typo3. Typo3 is one of the organizations that participated in the open source letter to the WordPress European Union related to the Cyber Resiliency Act. What does all that mean? Basically, the European Union has a lot of standards that they&#8217;re trying to implement, and the Cyber Resiliency Act specifies a lot of what they expect out of the software being used in various environments, and some of the wording that is in the Cyber Resiliency Act was not suitable for how open source works. And so out of that came, that&#8217;s exactly it. Joomla, Drupal, Typo3, WordPress and a few others that I think all compiled a letter together to the European Union specifying some of these things and Matthias that we met is part of the community at Typo3. Robert, did you get a chance to meet Matthias?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We got, of course, everyone got to meet everyone at some point, but we&#8217;re definitely going to push to have, is it Matthias or Mattias? I&#8217;m not always going to look Matthias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I&#8217;m an American and I butcher European names routinely. I will apologize first, but yes, we should invite him on as a guest and ask him to pronounce his own name for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />At least that, I mean, it&#8217;ll be a very quick podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yep, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;ll be brilliant. But yeah, I mean not only, it&#8217;s great that he was part of that open letter, but it&#8217;s interesting how, since we&#8217;re on the open talk on open source, how open source gets attacked in different weird ways and the Cyber Resilience Act, which is called CRA before we get all tongue-tied, it just seems strange to make demands of free code and why, yes, there need to be cybersecurity standards, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, last I checked, we can talk about CrowdStrike all day long and they&#8217;re probably CRA compliant, and that doesn&#8217;t really help anyone when Delta is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>still down for day five or six of being able to fly. The NHS, I think, had problems. European banks had problems. So some of these rules and regulations really don&#8217;t actually get to the crux of the problem, which is everyone needs to do their homework and stay on top of code no matter what it is and have processes in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Absolutely, Robert, I am glad that neither of us were traveling during that in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Oh my goodness, are you kidding? I just got home from WordCamp Canada to which I drove. It was a long drive, but I drove because the distance would not have been any different time-wise if I had flown. But still, I am glad to have gotten through Border Crossing and all of that without having an impact there. Related though to your idea there on testing and kind of coming in on the heels of WordPress 6.6.1 coming out and the calls for testing, I will amplify that people should be testing things and to the point where I have been relentless with my employer about giving me a little sliver of an environment to test on production. So in our managed environments and our enterprise-managed environments, I am ensuring that this gets at least the minimum testing possible. But in addition to that, I would like to call in those that are in the plugin and theme space and make sure that you are testing with the beta releases before we even hit RC. We need to be testing at the beta releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not just a good way to do this in the WordPress space as you go to make WordPress dot org slash test, and usually with every release there is a guideline post saying, here&#8217;s how you could go test the thing, do that, but in addition, do some other testing, both automated and manual with your own plugins and or themes. If you are a dev and or if you&#8217;re managing client sites, the ones that are the most on most of your client sites, I would make sure to also as a user, test those ahead because things will go a little sideways and you might see a maintenance release come in pretty quickly after that. If you are in other parts of open source, the same would still apply. You absolutely should be paying attention to what&#8217;s going on in releases ahead of time and testing and weighing that kind of feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;ll just second that, and it all circles back to the sustainability argument or discussion earlier. These things need to be done. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I will give a quick nod. When I was assembling today&#8217;s show notes, I forgot to include that I was on a panel at Europe about open source, about funding open source from the perspective, this time last year, I spoke with Hari and I was on a panel there from the perspective of I&#8217;m a contributor that wants to get sponsored. What can I do this time? It was from the perspective of empowering organizations such as my employer or Robert&#8217;s employer or a number of others to fund the work of open source. So I will be sure to include those as well. That slipped my mind in today&#8217;s show notes, but there we go. Related to other events and things going on in the open-source space. Robert, you brought up All Things Open. Do you know much about this conference? Have you ever attended?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I have never. And it keeps getting put into time slots where I can&#8217;t make it. It&#8217;s really about open source and everything from GitHub and Copilot to specific projects. Of course, AI, I already mentioned Copilot. That kind of stuff is happening. Speakers have been announced, and I&#8217;m just looking at, so we got Community Leadership Summit and All Things Open on October 27th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes, that is close to some timelines for my kiddos that I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to go yet or not, but I know a few others in the WordPress community that have attended in the past. You can reach out if you&#8217;re interested to Adam Silver and Nyasha Greene and find out what their experiences have been at this event. But it is really operated like a true open source without an organization besides the conference organizers, this is not an event on behalf of any one open-source project. It is an open-source event of lots of open-source people just getting together, and it&#8217;s one that I think is really, really interesting. It is in, is it North or South Carolina in the Carolinas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Raleigh, North Carolina, yeah. There we go. So if you&#8217;re interested in attending that one, do jump in, check it out, get some tickets. I always love the graphics that organization puts forward. I think it&#8217;d be a good time to also learn and connect with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I have been to the Community Leadership Summit in the past, and if you are heavily involved in a project, you should really have this on your radar. I remember having attended, and at the time it was all about codes of conduct and you had folks from all these projects trying to put together codes of conduct, codes of conduct or code of conducts, I dunno where the S goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Or the apostrophe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Or the, oh no, don&#8217;t make it worse. But these are the kinds of things that are addressed to help projects move forward. So definitely take a look at that if you are spending considerable time in any specific project, and that ties right into All Things Open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yeah, I would absolutely agree with that one. There are a couple of other things that have been popping on my radar just in the last week related to open source that are pretty interesting to check out. One of them started. So our show is not just about WordPress, but obviously we&#8217;re heavily steeped in the WordPress community and Do the Woo is related very much to all things WordPress related. I think they even have a show by that name. So a couple things that kind of popped up for me. I was watching a YouTube live with Matt Medeiros and Mark Szymanski, forgive me for not knowing how to pronounce your last name, but during this one, it&#8217;s great to see from Mark&#8217;s eyes sometimes because Mark is a young adult in his twenties, I believe, in the WordPress community and beginning to understand open source and contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that when I think about myself at that point, I was finding WordPress 2.3 and Moodle. So I come from other open source, and at that I found the WordPress philosophies and I thought, oh, this is for me, the ones numbered zero through three, the four philosophies of open source, that area spoke deeply to me about code being free, everyone can modify and edit and all of this and has really captivated me. I don&#8217;t know if today with as much software as is available and as much user experience as people can have at their fingertips. At that time, CMSs were new and WordPress WordPress was just for blogging and not for the rest of your website certainly. And there were no pages or sidebars or any of those things. So back then open source had a lot of potential and it really captivated a lot of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days though, the 20 something crowd is not necessarily thinking first about open source. They&#8217;re just thinking of the tool to get the job done. Open source may or may not be on the radar, and if they even are aware of how WordPress gets made, they may not understand their own responsibility for providing feedback. There is a talk I gave at WordCamp Montclair a year and a half ago, and I redid it at Phoenix as a backup speaker this year called We Are They, and it&#8217;s on WordPress TV, but it&#8217;s about this idea that if you&#8217;re using WordPress and you complain into the ether about why did they do this or that, to go log the issue in the place and provide that feedback. And there have been a few YouTubers in the last couple of days even that we&#8217;re really looking into one shedding light on the need to do that, but also two, hey, we&#8217;re logging this stuff and it&#8217;s maybe getting overlooked. And so there was some confusion around this that I thought maybe we could tackle a little bit. Robert, has there been a time in any open-source project where you have directed others to go provide some feedback? And how did that experience go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Oh gosh, it&#8217;s brutally painful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Why is that painful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s painful. People are not inspired. They don&#8217;t know. A lot of times the feedback loops aren&#8217;t there. So you might go in there the first time, drop a ticket, look at a repo and either be overwhelmed by whatever jargon exists, and then it just goes into the ether. Nine times out of 10, you&#8217;re waiting for someone to pick up that question, actually do something with that. To your point about Juliet, how many years was that sitting there? Again,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />It was a long time and it came down to I&#8217;m quitting doing this, I need to go pick up client work. Or you&#8217;re giving me the keys and we got to move it and I need funded. And I get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And so as folks get used to much more, I don&#8217;t want to say immediate gratification, but at least some kind of awareness of what&#8217;s going on. Open-source projects need to implement the expectation level of, oh, I hit a button at my bank and I got an immediate response either from a chatbot or a human being or whatever. We need to be able to do that. We need to keep up with the Joneses in that kind of user experience because submitting tickets is a user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yeah, so in the presentation that I did, if your issue was related to Gutenberg, here&#8217;s the Gutenberg repo, you could leave a comment and not provide code, and that&#8217;s okay. So if you want to either open up a discussion or reply to something, here&#8217;s how to go find and see if anyone else brought the topic up and then how to go provide feedback or how to open a new ticket. If it is related to the functionality of WordPress dot org&#8217;s website, where to go log that, that&#8217;s another place. And so the experience Mark was sharing is that he seems interested, I&#8217;m just getting to know him a little bit. He seems interested in doing these things, but he doesn&#8217;t know where to go to do it. And there&#8217;s not really a clear map of some of those things, how to log the feedback in the right places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have someone like Matt Medeiros who very understandably has been in our community in the WordPress space a long time. And in our project we have two dozen different teams, and then we have some working groups that aren&#8217;t attached to a team and we, oh, it&#8217;s a thing. And so how do you find where to go log this stuff or where are, for instance, proposals, that was something that Matt brought up and was sharing about searching through make WordPress dot org for proposals. I have provided a link for the show notes that&#8217;s basically just a customized Google search of show me anything on make dot WordPress dot org from all two dozen teams in the past. I dunno, I might&#8217;ve set it to a year that used the word proposal because there&#8217;s no other clear way to do that. But then over in Gutenberg, there are also proposals sitting inside of Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, and they don&#8217;t make it to a make website. And sometimes that&#8217;s the case for certain teams. Gutenberg is within core, but if you want to see the proposals about what the block editor is doing or the site editing experience is doing, you&#8217;re going to need to pay attention to it in the Gutenberg repo. And then what happens if you write a proposal? What&#8217;s the next step?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yes, that is a question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I&#8217;m shaking my hands, which no one can see. We&#8217;re audio-only. But it&#8217;s just like that both hands in the air of frustration of, again, the user experience of trying to get stuff done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So Robert in Joomla, how did proposals get handled?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />To some degree, it was a much smaller community and we didn&#8217;t have 4,000 teams like WordPress does. So it was much easier to actually get in front of team leads just right off the bat and be like, here&#8217;s my proposal, here&#8217;s my idea. Then team leads would take and run with that. So being able just to have that contact with the leader of what&#8217;s going on, then that would be actually put into more of the big development process or bug fixes or proposals and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />So to that point, in WordPress, we do not use the term lead outside of, we have core release leads. Matt, usually, is that on most of the release processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Matt Mullenweg. There&#8217;s lots of Matts in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes. And then we have some folks that historically have held this title and it&#8217;s now become more of an honorary title. Folks like if you&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space, Helen Hou-Sandí and others, Dion Hulse, this crew are some of the originals of the release lead cycle and process. Some of them are still with the project and some are no longer with the project, but proposals overall across all the teams, there is no uniformity to that in our case. Other open source projects, like for instance later in the show notes, I have one on PHP has a request for comments, which is a bit akin to a proposal. It&#8217;s saying, here&#8217;s the pitch, give some comments, and then they have a defined procedure after you give those comments if it needs to go to a vote, who does the voting, et cetera. And these are points that Mark was bringing up.<br />Is there any standardized? What happens after someone writes a proposal? Well, sometimes it just sits there. Earlier today I had a meeting related to, there is a post in our show notes here about should the DEIB working group Five for the Future new contributor mentorship be all merged inside of the sustainability team? And it was brought up that Birgit Olzem had written a proposal for a DEIB team exclusively like a year ago. And right now it&#8217;s just waiting on Matt to respond to one way or the other. And for lack of a response, there&#8217;s a lack of activity happening. And that experience for the community is not ideal. There&#8217;s no standardization to the process. And also are the proposals going to be on make or are they going to be in a GitHub repo or what team site should something like that go to and how do we handle those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it was covered pretty well in this particular video, but I can understand why people have these questions. And I&#8217;m seeing currently a couple of other YouTubers that are expressing similar concerns, similar questions, and confusion. And what I want to sort of emphasize there is to look at it again, with fresh eyes, there are some people that are new to understanding contribution no matter what their age, they&#8217;re just new to experiencing what it means to contribute or where to provide appropriate feedback besides just yelling into YouTube and Twitter. I mean, those feel soothing for a moment or two, but it does nothing to actually, it&#8217;s not recorded somewhere that people could take action on that, right? It&#8217;s not somewhere that people have to be confronted with dealing with that type of thing and seeing a bit of that type of activity going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also there are some questions. So WPTuts, on YouTube, I don&#8217;t recall the gentleman&#8217;s name. I can say that the gentleman that was doing WPTuts the YouTube video also had a lot of those same kind of thoughts, questions, and concerns. If I provide the feedback, is anyone paying attention? I saw recently a contributor Aurooba, a couple of us know who Aurooba is in our community. Aurooba provided a pull request, which means that she fixed it in code, she saw a bug, she fixed it in code, she submitted a pull request to Gutenberg, and then in 6.6, that bug was fixed by somebody else&#8217;s more recent rendition of the same solution and how inappropriate that that can feel and what can we do to sort of wrangle some of those experiences in a bit better. And so that&#8217;s a little bit of what I&#8217;m observing, and it relates a bit to, for instance, governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has sometimes been a hot topic. I&#8217;m not going to make it one today, but Red Hat has a really good article, ironically, Red Hat who took Red Hat Enterprise Linux that runs a lot of hosting environments and pulled it back to private. Red Hat has a good article about the different kinds of governance models. And on some of the same videos, people were inquiring what type of governance model is WordPress because things like proposals have no standardization, and we do fall under what&#8217;s known as Benevolent Dictator for Life. Matt does not enjoy that term, but it is not unique to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Linux in general is, I mean, Linus Torvaldsds, that&#8217;s where it was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes, exactly. And so basically a lot of the decision-making process resides upon the Project co-founder at this time, and that&#8217;s why procedures are maybe where they are looking for a way forward. I&#8217;m going to keep pushing on looking for how we can improve this process. I recognize that our project leadership is a small crew that has a lot of responsibility, especially when 43% of the web rides on their decision-making. So improving that experience is something that I care deeply about, about how we can continue encouraging folks to come provide that feedback, and then ensuring that things like what Aurooba experienced don&#8217;t fall off the radar that we continually look for, oh, here&#8217;s somebody actually already solved the thing, or somebody provided some really valuable feedback. How do we get this feedback heard by those that need to and take action upon it? It&#8217;s a lot to kind of wrangle and deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I admire recently that Anne McCarthy organized a bunch of the YouTubers that seem to have similar interests like this together for a video to try and unite the YouTuber community because that is a weird niche. I would say they&#8217;re not going to be as much active in Make WordPress Slack, although I&#8217;ve seen more of that and I&#8217;m delighted by it. But they have a whole subset of the community that we don&#8217;t see at events. They have a whole subset of the community that we don&#8217;t see in Slack, and they can really help bridge those connections if done correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yes, I mean, I would just love to have every you dropped &#8217;em in, but just now. But really, if you&#8217;re interested in working on the project in WordPress, step one, make WordPress, get on that Slack. A lot of these questions when I talked about, or when you asked about how was this kind of feedback done in the Joomla space, and this is years ago. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s changed now, but at least get on the Slack. You can find the leaders and have that direct question answered one way or the other. And it would be nice if every team had almost like a triage coordinator, just to Courtney&#8217;s eyes just really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I&#8217;m nodding. I&#8217;m thinking, oh, I would love to see project manager layers throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;m just going for triage. You&#8217;re required to get back within 30 to 60 days and flag it for yes, this will move forward, or no, don&#8217;t have time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I think in addition, maybe Robert, we do have triage work that happens, especially for Core Editor. I know Damon Cook has been really working on that one. Damon contributes on behalf of WP Engine. There are a few others that are in that space for sure. But also I think that we need to do that holistically throughout the whole project. Last bit of news that I have coming in is that just issued within the past week</p>\n\n\n\n<p>, is the state of React informal report about the React community. About React, the open-source project as well. It is part of the JavaScript community holistically. It&#8217;s a lot of what Gutenberg is built on. You can</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Check out. I was going to say, why do we care about React?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Yes, Gutenberg. Gutenberg uses a lot of React. So you could find that information at 2023 dot state of react.com. It will be in the show notes, but it&#8217;s really interesting to look at contributors to the React community and what kind of feedback that they are offering too. So that&#8217;s the hit list of the news that I&#8217;ve got for this week. It was good seeing you, Robert, and I look forward to our next episode together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Great seeing you again, Courtney. Now that we have at least August, I think minimal to no work, travel break before WordCamp US hits us square in the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />I know I&#8217;m the lead organizer for contributor day, so I will have a lot more brainpower in October during Hacktoberfest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Thank you, Courtney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney:<br />Thank you, Robert.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>Open Talk on Open Source</strong>, hosts <strong>Courtney and Robert </strong>recap their experiences at WordCamp Europe, highlighting key presentations on the future sustainability of open source by Joost and Juliet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a conversation about the importance of community connections, the challenges in WordPress contributions, and the necessity of funding and supporting open source projects.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things, WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, making the web a better place for those who are deaf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Elena Panciera and Chiara Pennetta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elena is a freelance consultant specializing in inclusive and accessible languages. She champions, linguistic inclusivity, advocating for simplifying language to aid understanding for non-native speakers across all languages. She believes in providing tools to make text more comprehensible for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiara has been a special needs educator for the past two years. Deaf since infancy, Chiara underwent cochlear implant surgery four years ago, significantly improving her hearing. This transformative experience deepened, and altered, her connection to her deaf identity, and spurred her to explore issues of deafness and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re joining us to discuss the important topic of accessibility online. Accessibility is often an overlooked aspect of web development and event planning, and there are significant challenges and opportunities in making content accessible to diverse audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elena and Chiara walk us through their personal journeys and professional insights, shedding light on the varying needs within the deaf community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiara shares her experiences of navigating a world that is increasingly leaning towards video content. And how platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have improved accessibility through automatic captioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elena highlights the importance of these features, not only for deaf individuals, but also for a broader audience that benefits from reading captions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the implications of the European Accessibility Act, set to revolutionize accessibility requirements for websites. What will this mean for developers and content creators? Are captions enough, or should we aim for sign language interpretations as well, despite their complexity and cost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about the essential principles of simplification in transcription, and our AI tools are shaping how we deliver accessible content. Chiara emphasizes the diverse needs of individuals with hearing impairments, and why aligning transcriptions with the original content is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we explore technologies which are improving communication for the deaf community, and the practical steps WordPress events can take to be more inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a web developer, event planner, or just passionate about accessibility, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Elena Panciera and Chiara Pennetta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Elena Panciera and Chiara Pannetta. Very nice to have you both with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re in WordCamp Europe. It is Saturday, so it&#8217;s the final day of the conference, and I&#8217;m talking to these two fine people about a topic that they spoke about. It was yesterday I think, and so we&#8217;re going to get into that topic in a moment. And it&#8217;s a topic that, I confess, I don&#8217;t know very much about. So hopefully they&#8217;re going to tell me, and educate me a lot about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we do that, one at a time, could I ask you just to introduce yourselves. Tell us a little bit about who you are, where you come from, where you live, what you do for a living, that kind of thing. So let&#8217;s go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Hi, I&#8217;m Elena Panciera, and I&#8217;m a freelance consultant. I&#8217;m expert about inclusive and accessible languages. And, well, I work as a freelancer, so I&#8217;m a trainer, I make consultancies about accessibility, and about how to be kind and respectful with language. This is what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:06] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Hello, my name is Chiara Pennetta. I am 30 years old from Italy. I work as a teacher in special needs education, since two years ago. I studied Ancient Greek and Latin, and then I specialised in teaching Italian as a second language. But four years ago, I got two cochlear implants because I am deaf since I was one and a half years ago. Five years ago in fact, I chose to try and improve my hearing with this surgery, which is called cochlear implant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that moment I became more hearing from a medical point of view, but I became also more deaf from an identity point of view. And so I chose to delve more into the topic of deafness and accessibility. And that was when I opened my Instagram page, which is called the undeaf, because I don&#8217;t feel hearing nor deaf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was when I met Elena, and we started studying, and working together to make the world a more accessible place. And that was also when I decided to be a teacher for the people with disabilities in high school here in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Can I just ask you, you said that your medical deafness had improved, but your, I think you said identity. Did you say identity? Your identity deafness or something. What did that mean? What did you mean by that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:42] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> I think that deafness is considered a disability by most people. So the lack of hearing. But deafness is also a community, a culture, and a language. Because if you start studying sign language like I did four years ago, you will find out that there is a new whole world to discover about deaf identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, that was life changing. It&#8217;s a paradox because I found out about my deaf identity only when I improved my hearing. It&#8217;s a paradox I know. But my cochlear implant are more visible than the hearing aid I have had before. And so my deafness became more visible, but also more invisible because my speech improved. My access to the world of sounds improved. Also my identity, like I said before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. Okay, thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So during the course of this interview, I will be asking questions, and it doesn&#8217;t really matter who wants to take it, but thank you for the introductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s begin then. So the first question that I&#8217;ve got really is, well, I should probably introduce what you spoke about at WordCamp Europe. Your topic was called Digital and Linguistic Accessibility Techniques and Strategies for deaf people. So we&#8217;re going to try and explore that a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my first question then is, what kind of experiences on the web are different if you are deaf? So I am in the fortunate position to have good eyesight, I wear glasses, but I have good eyesight. You know, my hands and my legs all work. I can hold a mouse, I can type on a keyboard, and my hearing is good. So I genuinely don&#8217;t know what it would be like to browse the internet, to move around online if I couldn&#8217;t hear. So could you just describe the difference it would be, for me, if I had deafness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:44] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Sure. I think that the biggest difference is about all the video, and sound, musical content, of course. So anything that you experience with your hearing is different, if you don&#8217;t have hearing at all, or are partially deaf. Any video, any podcast of course, any web content which is accessible by audio feed, needs to be supported with the captions or transcription, or like signals. I don&#8217;t know, maybe it is not web related, but in movies when you have captions, and someone knocks at the door, the captions signal that there is someone knocking. So sound signals and transcription is really important. I think that that&#8217;s the most important thing to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yesterday, Elena and I really focus that, in many occasions, captions and transcription are not enough. Because many people who are born deaf, and maybe don&#8217;t use hearing aids, sometimes are not proficient in understanding an oral spoken language, even if it is in a written form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they can have struggles in understanding complex, and the longest sentences with the complex syntax, and the vocabulary. Elena, which she&#8217;s expert in language accessibilities, really gave tools to write in a way that is accessible to people who don&#8217;t have a high level of proficiency in understanding a written text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, so the assumption then that if I, for example, produce a video, and I&#8217;m very, the word I&#8217;m going to use is verbose, meaning I use too much language, I&#8217;m talking but my sentences are complicated and what have you. Are you suggesting then you need to bear in mind making it more straightforward? Because if I&#8217;m reading it, it might also be the case that my level of cognition, understanding what I&#8217;m reading, may also impact my ability to understand that content. So whoever wants to take that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:54] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Yes, actually, we have to keep in mind that not everybody has the same level of proficiency in any language, and especially in Italian. Because in English it&#8217;s quite easier to have shorter sentences, and since it&#8217;s a very commonly used language amongst a lot of people that have other languages as first languages, English is more simple. But in Italian, for example, we commonly use very long sentences, with a lot of clauses that are not coordinate clauses, and subjunctives, and a lot of difficult words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oral Italian is simpler, and the written Italian, we tend to use more difficult words, and more difficult structures. And so it&#8217;s important to keep it simple, and to try to think that not everybody have Italian as a first language. And this happens also for every other language. So for English, but also for German, for Spanish and so on. And so we have tools that can help us trying to make a text simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also artificial intelligence that can help us. There are ChatGPT, and Gemini, for example, but also tools that are integrated into WordPress. For example, Yoast or Semrush have tools that help simplify text, and choose simpler words, and more common words, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I ask you a question about this podcast? So when I have finished editing this, I will make a transcription and I will try to make it perfect, exactly what you say. However, sometimes, because you are speaking in your native language is Italian, I sometimes take the position that it&#8217;s better for me to translate it into the English that I would like you to have said, if you were an English speaker. What do you think about that? I&#8217;m sometimes faced with the difficult thing, okay, I think they meant to say it this way, so I&#8217;ll write it that way, whereas you didn&#8217;t actually say it that way. What should I do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:25] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Actually, this is a very interesting question, because I think there are also different positions about that. Because sometimes I&#8217;ve been told that it&#8217;s better to have very, very, transcriptions that are perfect. And so they transcript exactly what the speaker said. But actually, in terms of accessibility, maybe it could be more interesting, even simplify a little bit the language. So make the sentences shorter and, I don&#8217;t know, adapt a little bit the transcription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> I would like to add something on this topic. I don&#8217;t know if you ever noticed that in many movies when you buy the DVD, or Netflix too I think, you can choose from normal captions, basic captions, and the caption that are all called subtitles for the hearing impaired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have not come across that. So this is new. It&#8217;s interesting, keep going, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:25] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Sometimes you have two kinds of transcription for movies, or a TV series because basic captions transcribe literally everything that the actors say. While captions for deaf people are often simplified in the vocabulary and grammar, because maybe the proficiency language is a bit different, and they need a language structure which is more simple and accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And also, I would imagine keeping up. Being able to read at the speed that somebody is saying something. So if a, let&#8217;s imagine a movie on Netflix, if an actor is speaking fairly quickly, and you are transcribing every single word, it&#8217;s hard to read at the speed of speech. If we just take out unnecessary words and just sum up the idea behind it. That&#8217;s really interesting because you have to have an opinion about what they intended to say, and how much you can simplify it, because you might lose some of the context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can do both. You put the exact transcript, but you have the secondary choice, I&#8217;m going to use air quotes, the simpler version, fewer words, easier to understand, less complicated words, shorter words. Ah, that&#8217;s really interesting. I had no idea that existed. Do you want to add something to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:46] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> This is the principle of simplify and facilitate. So there are these two different concepts, the simplification and facilitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplification means that we adapt and change the original text. And with facilitation, we can add tools to help the reader understand the text, but the original text that remain the same. You can add glossaries. You can add another version, a simplified version, or a shorter version. Because we could have also difficulties in keeping up the attention for a long time, and to read a very long text, this could be difficult. So yeah, we have different tools to improve the accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually accessibility is multimedia, and going across different tools, and different medias. For example, the transcription is different from the audio, and also we can add graphics, illustrations, or visual tools to improve the understanding for text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What do these tools do? So I&#8217;m imagining that I&#8217;ve transcribed this, and I&#8217;ve got my perfect, in air quotes, transcription. I&#8217;m really happy with it. Do I then just copy and paste what I&#8217;ve got, put it into a tool, click a button, and it will go through it with artificial intelligence, for example, and just shorten everything, make it more brief, as we&#8217;ve just described. What do these tools do? And could you name a few, because I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve never heard of any of them, so I&#8217;d like to go out and find what some of them are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:33] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Actually, yes, there are some tools like ChatGPT, Gemini. Or specific tools like Capito that can help you doing this in a automatic way. But actually it&#8217;s always better, in my opinion, to check what the artificial intelligence do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The human intelligence is still better than the artificial one. And actually you can use your critical sense. I don&#8217;t know if I can use this in English? Yes, because you can really think what is important, and maybe you can also ask, in your case, you could ask us, what would you mean with this sentence? Because it was not in a perfect English, so we can tell you and make it right. I don&#8217;t know how to say, but let the mistakes be only in the oral podcast, and make a better version in the written text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, so a good example of that that&#8217;s coming into my mind might be, if both of us said, I don&#8217;t know the word like a lot. It&#8217;s commonly used in English, we say like, like, like, like, and also um, um, you know, those kind of things. Would you want that to be kept in a transcription, or even the audio? Because I tend to, when I edit this podcast, I tend to get rid of the bits, well, for example, of silence. There might be five seconds of silence where you think of your answer in this podcast episode. I take the position, let&#8217;s get rid of that silence. Let&#8217;s make it just so that one word follows the next word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also I take out the ums, and the ahs, and the likes and things. I&#8217;m really making a completely new version of what you said. Is that a good idea? Would you prefer to listen to exactly what we record today? Or is it okay to edit things out? Is there a better way of doing it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:28] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> I think oral version of a thing and the written version, or the painted version, or the dance version of something are, of course, different things, because they&#8217;re different products. So we can&#8217;t expect to be the same, it wouldn&#8217;t be right. They are two different things, so it&#8217;s normal. That&#8217;s not the same thing because you can, you perceive those two things with two different senses. And so I think it is right to delete the ums and the like, because it will be not pleasurable to read a text full of ums and like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends also, what is the main goal that you want to achieve with that text? It is more important that people can understand what the vibe was, or what the content was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that it is also really personal because, for example, I can hear pretty well with my cochlear implant, so I like my caption and my transcriptions to be really faithful to the original. Because if I hear, and at the same time I read, I like those two things to be the same. Or maybe if I watch a movie, I like that, when I see the lips moving, I hear the same thing, and I read the same thing on my captions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other deaf people, or maybe other people who need other kind of accessibilities, like people with learning difficulties, or people who with cognitive disabilities, they may need, and want, a different kind of test, to more get to the point, to more understand it. So I think that it is impossible to have a solution which is perfect for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess one of the things that I could do, if I had enough time and enough resources, I could also translate this from English, and have it in Italian, or Spanish, or Portuguese, or whatever language we can imagine. It will just be done in English though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, the ability to read a language gives you more options to make something visible, available to people from different cultures. If it&#8217;s just a YouTube video with no captions, no subtitles, and it&#8217;s just in English, only English people, or not English people, English speaking people can understand that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you throw in the captions and the subtitles, you can actually make the exact same piece of content available to the whole world. If you could translate it into Chinese, and Japanese, and everything. But unfortunately, that&#8217;s not going to be the case, in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, back to the questions. This may seem like a silly question because, as I said, I have good hearing. Does the amount of deafness, and I don&#8217;t know what the correct word is for that but, for example, imagine somebody who has no hearing at all. Or somebody who has partial hearing, maybe one ear isn&#8217;t working as well, or if they can hear half of the sounds, or anything in between. Is there a difference there? Do we have to make things available in different ways? Just tell us what that&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Yeah, I think we should talk about deafnesses, plural. Because we have a wide variety of shades of deafness. Mainly since when a technology came in, I don&#8217;t know if 70 years ago we didn&#8217;t have hearing aids and cochlear implant, which work in a certain way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we have a wide amount of technology that can help retrieve our hearing. But even if two people with the same level of hearing loss use the same kind of hearing aid, it is not obvious that they could gain the same amount of hearing gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So definitely is a wide word, it depends on when you lose your hearing, before or after the age in which children learn to speak. And so we have prelingual or postlingual deafness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course you can lose your healing at different levels. So mild or profound hearing loss are different. Or we have deafness for elderly people, so late life. It&#8217;s a really, really wide word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people learn sign languages since they are little children because they are born in deaf families, into deaf culture. Some others don&#8217;t, like I became deaf when I was one year and a half, and I was born in a hearing family. So I didn&#8217;t learn sign language up until four years ago for my personal curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that I learn how to speak through hearing aids and speech therapy. But I know many people who have the same amount of hearing loss as me, from a medical point of view, but have really different speech ability and language ability. We have a very wide, a very big variety of deaf world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it feels to me like, when the internet came along, I don&#8217;t know, 1995 or something like that, that being a deaf person, you could access almost all of the internet because it was just images and text, that&#8217;s how the internet began. But more and more, fast forward to 2005, or whenever YouTube came along, video content started to rapidly take over. And now with TikTok, and apps, and the phone that you&#8217;ve got in your pocket, it feels like there&#8217;s more and more content that&#8217;s inaccessible to deaf people. Is that a trend? Is it becoming harder to use the internet? Things like YouTube, like I say, and TikTok, is that kind of taking over and making it more difficult?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:15] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> I don&#8217;t think it is becoming harder. I think that, maybe in the beginning, when videos weren&#8217;t captioned, yes. But now, we have automatic captions on TikTok, on Instagram mostly, and on YouTube. So even if the content creator doesn&#8217;t put on their captions, or their transcription, it is possible to activate automatic caption or automatic transcription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just ask, do you need to tell TikTok or YouTube to do that, or does it automatically do it for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:48] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Yes, it&#8217;s the user responsibility because you have to click on a button to activate captions. But I think that deaf people&#8217;s lives changed with the internet because, I don&#8217;t remember the name, but back in the old days, it was invented like a phone who transcribed the phone calls. And when we started having video calls, deaf people were so happy because they could call each other, seeing each other, and use sign language during their phone calls. And so communication really exploded. It was a right that came a bit later for the deaf community, the signing deaf community of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:30] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> I think that also, the ability to read lips with video calls is a good accessibility sign. And captioning is getting better actually. And also, captioning is not used only by deaf people. Actually, I am one of those people that need captions because otherwise I hate the vocal messages. And I hate these kind of messages that are only oral, and so I prefer to read. And I&#8217;m not deaf actually, so accessibility can really help a lot of people, even if they&#8217;re not with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> From everything that you&#8217;ve said, it really does sound like technology has improved dramatically the life of people who are deaf, and obviously you said it&#8217;s a spectrum. Yeah, when you mentioned about video calls, I hadn&#8217;t even thought about that. But suddenly you can see the person, lip read maybe, but also the sign language. It just made communication over a distance suddenly possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could speak to people from all over the world, not rely on hearing, which of course on the phone call, the regular phone call, if you can&#8217;t see it, you couldn&#8217;t interact with it at all. Profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So technology is really helping. And I&#8217;ve got to say, dear listener, in front of me, about two feet away, I don&#8217;t know whose it is, but is a mobile phone. And the mobile phone is facing you two, and it&#8217;s translating in real time. And I&#8217;m watching it now, you&#8217;ve just turned it around so that I can see. So it&#8217;s two feet away, it must have the microphone switched on, and it&#8217;s translating everything I&#8217;m saying, and it&#8217;s translating it literally perfectly. It&#8217;s astonishing. And this is, what, just Google? Just Google?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:20] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s like a Google transcribe. There is an app free on the Google store. And this is my phone actually, because I have an Android phone, and she has an iPhone, that is more accessible for other things, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But, whether you&#8217;ve got an Android phone or an iPhone, I am blown away by how good that is. And obviously I&#8217;ve never had to use it, so I&#8217;ve never really seen it. Can I just ask, dare I say, we&#8217;re going off message a little bit. Would that also enable me to talk to you in Italian? So for example, could it translate my English words, and the text on the screen would then be Italian? Can it do that as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:03] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Well, no. I think that you can, no, I know that you can set the language in which you are speaking. So if you now start speaking in Italian, I have to switch, on the app, the language to Italian, and it&#8217;ll start transcribing in Italian, or in any other language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if I wanted a live translation too, I think I&#8217;d have to use a computer, and open another app with artificial intelligence, that could transcribe and translate at the same time. There are application that can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually saw, maybe yesterday, I saw on the laptop of the people who are helping out in the speech on the track one, and they had an application I think that said, if you want to change, on your device, the language of the captions, you could. So I think there may be people who couldn&#8217;t understand English, because yesterday we spoke in English, and there were also captions on the main screen, projected in English, that transcribed like now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think maybe you could download an app or something that also translates into another language. So this is all the work of artificial intelligence. So I think that maybe because languages are so rich, and different, I think it is impossible to achieve a perfect translation. For the main content I think it&#8217;s useful as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Genuinely, I&#8217;m astonished by how good that is. And it&#8217;s enabling me, I mean you could have had headphones in, but you&#8217;ve chosen not to, but I&#8217;m noticing that you are looking down at it, and so you are seeing and reading what I&#8217;m saying in real time. That is profoundly amazing. This kind of stuff must make life a lot more straightforward, and a lot simpler. Yeah, that&#8217;s absolutely brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off pieced again, how do we do at WordPress events, helping out people who are deaf? Do we get it right? Do we have the right balance of, I don&#8217;t know, sign language, captioning? Do we do pretty well, or is there work that we still need to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:18] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Well, I am very happy with the captions, but I didn&#8217;t see any sign language interpreter. I don&#8217;t know if there, I didn&#8217;t see any, that&#8217;s my opinion, my experience. But I also didn&#8217;t ask for it because, even if I know sign language, I don&#8217;t rely on it to access to the world. So maybe if I ask for it, it would be possible to gain an interpreter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the problem is, I only know Italian sign language. Since there are many sign languages in the world that I don&#8217;t know, British or American sign language, I think it&#8217;ll be difficult to find an interpreter who can listen to English, and then in his or her mind, translate into Italian, and then translate again into Italian sign language. There are people who can, amazing people, but it&#8217;s not easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or we could ask for an international sign interpreter. And the international sign is not an actual language, but it&#8217;s a mix of different sign languages, mostly based on ASL American Sign Language. And so I think that I could understand it, but I never tried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m really happy with the organisation. It was the first time for me to attend the WorldPress conference, nevertheless WordCamp Europe, so I felt really welcome, and my needs were met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Good. Yeah, well, I&#8217;m pleased to hear it. I&#8217;ve no clue really as to whether or not, at some events, they do have sign language. But yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting point, I hadn&#8217;t really thought about that. It would have to be, the sign language would have to be, in English or American English, whichever. And then you would also have to understand that, as somebody that was using sign language, you&#8217;d have to not only be able to use the English sign language, but then presumably you&#8217;d have to translate it in your own head into Italian. So that, yeah, that would make life really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:18] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Yeah. Actually, in this kind of event, I think that the best solution is to ask people attending the conference, what do you need? Because actually, maybe you could have a person from France that communicates with French sign language, and they could need French sign language. And so it&#8217;s easier to meet their need, and to ask French sign language interpreter to help them. Because otherwise it could be really, really, expensive, you know, to translate versus toward every language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You can imagine there&#8217;d be 15 people standing on the stage, with the French translation, or the sign language, the English, the, I don&#8217;t know, Portuguese, or whatever. Yeah, that could be interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know neither of you are lawyers. We established that at the beginning, but just, I&#8217;m near the end now, my question is all about website builders, people who build websites. That&#8217;s what most of us are here for. We&#8217;re building websites using WordPress to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any responsibility, any legal things that we need to know about? I know that in 2025 we&#8217;ve got the European Accessibility Act. Will it become required, for example, with video to have captions, things like that? Do you know? And I, again, I stress, you&#8217;re not lawyers, we understand. But, do you know if we, as website builders, are compelled to do that? I know that we should do that, it would be the right thing to do, and the moral thing to do. But I think sometimes it&#8217;s easy to not do those things because it&#8217;s cheaper, quicker, all of those things. So do you know if there&#8217;s any compulsion, any legal reason that we must do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:58] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Actually, yes. From the 2025, we have to think in a different way about accessibility because there is the European Accessibility Act that is going to be followed. We have to follow this act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, there are different levels of accessibility, and the captions, for example, they&#8217;re quite simple, and quite cheap with artificial intelligence. For example, a translation in sign language would be another level of accessibility that is not mandatory. It depends on how the budget is, and how also the aim of the company is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because maybe if a company know that it&#8217;s public, its audience is mainly, or a huge amount of people is deaf, it could decide to invest some money into having a sign language interpreter, for example, that is not mandatory. But the captions, well, are supposed to be there. And, yeah, also other things, transcriptions, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ll have to wait and see, won&#8217;t we, how well it&#8217;s enforced next year. Because we&#8217;ll have the legislation, but it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if people adhere to it. And if they don&#8217;t adhere to it, whether or not they get, well, punished, for want of a better word. We&#8217;ll just have to see how that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think with the time coming up to nearly the hour, we&#8217;ll knock it on the head, as we say in the UK. We&#8217;ll end it there. But thank you for speaking to me about this today. I&#8217;m going to be really curious what you make of the transcription, and the edit of the audio that I do from this. I&#8217;m fascinated to see whether I over edited it. Whether I took out the ums, and the ahs, and the silences that we had, we are going to edit some mistakes out and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m more curious about what you think of the transcription that I do, and whether or not it&#8217;s what you would&#8217;ve liked it to have been, or whether or not I overdid it. So let&#8217;s wait and see. I&#8217;ll send it to you before it comes out. But thank you so much for chatting to me today, both of you. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:11] <strong>Chiara Pennetta:</strong> Thank you to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] <strong>Elena Panciera:</strong> Thank you. It was really a pleasure to be here.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Elena Panciera &amp; Chiara Pennetta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elena is a freelance consultant specialising in inclusive and accessible languages. She champions linguistic inclusivity, advocating for simplifying language to aid understanding for non-native speakers across all languages. She believes in providing tools to make text more comprehensible for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiara Pennetta has been a special needs educator for the past two years. Deaf since infancy, Chiara underwent cochlear implant surgery four years ago, significantly improving her hearing. This transformative experience deepened, and altered, her connection to her deaf identity and spurred her to explore issues of deafness and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re joining us to discuss the important topic of accessibility online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is often an overlooked aspect of web development and event planning, and there are significant challenges and opportunities in making content accessible to diverse audiences. Elena and Chiara walk us through their personal journeys and professional insights, shedding light on the varying needs within the deaf community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiara shares her experiences of navigating a world that is increasingly leaning towards video content, and how platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have improved accessibility through automatic captioning. Elena highlights the importance of these features, not only for deaf individuals, but also for a broader audience that benefits from reading captions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the implications of the European Accessibility Act, set to revolutionise accessibility requirements for websites. What will this mean for developers and content creators? Are captions enough, or should we aim for sign language interpretations as well, despite their complexity and cost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about the essential principles of simplification in transcription, and how AI tools are shaping how we deliver accessible content. Chiara emphasises the diverse needs of individuals with hearing impairments and why aligning transcriptions with the original content is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we explore technologies which are improving communication for the deaf community, and the practical steps WordPress events can take to be more inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a web developer, event planner, or just passionate about accessibility, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Elena and Chiara&#8217;s WordCamp Europe presentation: <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/digital-and-linguistic-accessibility-techniques-and-strategies-for-deaf-people/\">Digital and linguistic accessibility techniques and strategies for deaf people</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">Semrush</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\">Gemini</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.capito.eu/en/capitodigital/\">Capito</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-audio-more-accessible-two-new-apps/\">Google Transcribe</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Landing Page Conversion Rates: 24 Proven Ways to Optimize Them\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284070\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://akismet.com/blog/landing-page-conversion-rate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39947:\"<p>Your landing page is where first impressions are made. And from there, it’s where potential customers decide if they want to do business with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">large enterprise</a> or a small business, this is an undeniable fact. Which means optimizing your landing page is super important. Your aim? To strive for more engagement and a higher conversion rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Conversion Benchmark Report</a> put together by Unbounce, the median conversion rate for landing pages across all industries is 4.3%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can you ensure your landing pages meet that metric or do even better than average?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we’re covering 24 proven ways to boost your landing page conversion rates. These practical tips are designed to help you capture more leads and increase sales, regardless of whether you&#8217;re using WordPress or another platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284070\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-create-a-captivating-header-or-hero section\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Create a captivating header or hero&nbsp;section</h2>\n\n<p>The header or hero section is the first thing visitors see on your landing page, so it needs to grab their attention and clearly communicate your value proposition. But more on that in a&nbsp;moment.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to use large, bold fonts to make your message stand out, and complement this with high&#8209;resolution images or background videos. The <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Calm app</a>, for instance, uses ample white space and clear, compelling visuals to draw people&nbsp;in.</p>\n\n\n<p>The image selected radiates a sense of calm — exactly what you’d hope to experience with the product at hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image.jpeg\" alt=\"the Calm app website with two CTA buttons\" class=\"wp-image-284072\" />\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-state-a-clear-value proposition\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. State a clear value&nbsp;proposition</h2>\n\n<p>Your value proposition should succinctly explain how your product or service solves customers&#8217; problems. Or it might show how it improves their situation or delivers specific benefits. No matter your approach, it should tell your ideal customer why they should buy from you and not from the competition. And it shouldn’t take an entire paragraph to accomplish this&nbsp;mission.</p>\n\n\n<p>An effective value proposition is a pretty important cornerstone for your entire marketing program —&nbsp;not just your landing pages. So if you don’t already have a permanent value proposition established for your company, you’ll want to spend some extra time with this step. Here are some extra tips to make the most of your efforts:</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"be-specific-and-focus-on-tangible benefits\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be specific and focus on tangible&nbsp;benefits</h3>\n\n\n<p>Steer clear of vague statements and industry jargon. Instead, talk about specific outcomes customers can expect and benefits you offer. So, instead of saying &#8220;Improve your productivity,&#8221; specify how and by how much. Something like, &#8220;Reduce unnecessary meetings to boost your team&#8217;s productivity by 40% in just one month&#8221;,​ is a much clearer value proposition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"address-your-ideal-customerâs-pain points\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Address your ideal customer’s pain&nbsp;points</h3>\n\n<p>Understand your customers&#8217; challenges and explain how your product or service addresses these issues. Conducting customer research and gathering feedback can help you pinpoint these needs and incorporate them into your landing page&nbsp;copy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emphasize-what-sets-you apart\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Emphasize what sets you&nbsp;apart</h3>\n\n\n<p>This could be unique features, superior quality, exceptional customer service, or some new technology. Take P2 as an example. ​They keep their homepage or landing page simple, with a headline visible immediately. As of 2024, it includes, “A platform for teams to share, discuss, and collaborate openly, without interruption.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"838\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image.png\" alt=\"P2 homepage with a clear value proposition\" class=\"wp-image-284074\" />\n\n\n\n<p>And a quick scroll makes it abundantly clear that the value proposition here is a streamlined team communication and work reporting platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-write-compelling headlines\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Write compelling&nbsp;headlines</h2>\n\n\n<p>A compelling headline is critical for capturing your audience’s attention and encouraging them to read further. It’s the first thing visitors notice, and it sets the tone for the rest of your landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create headlines that convert, you need to ensure they immediately convey what your product or service is and the primary benefit it offers. Avoid ambiguous or clever phrases that might confuse visitors. Clear and direct headlines ensure that visitors understand the core message at a glance. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com\">Grammarly</a> features a few headlines on its landing page, including, “Better writing, better results.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Grammarly homepage with a clear headling\" class=\"wp-image-284076\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these headlines make it clear what customers stand to gain from using this service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the benefit-focus, you can also follow a couple of tried and true rules for writing compelling headlines. For instance, you can use powerful words that evoke emotion and encourage action, like “Transform” or “Discover”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Including numbers or specific data in your headline can make it more credible, too. Statistics, percentages, and specific figures attract more attention than generic statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-use visuals\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Use&nbsp;visuals</h2>\n\n\n<p>Visual elements matter a great deal, too. They help to break up text, illustrate key points, and keep visitors interested. So it’s obviously worthwhile to include only high-quality images on your landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Doing so will make it look more professional. Any old image won’t do, however. Make sure the visuals you select are relevant to your content. For example, lifestyle images that depict people using your product in real&#8209;life scenarios can create an emotional connection with&nbsp;visitors​.</p>\n\n\n<p>You could make use of background videos, too. These add a dynamic element to your hero section, making it more engaging. They should be short, relevant, and high-quality — of course — and feed into the overall visual narrative of your landing page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>A strategically&#8209;placed infographic is a nice touch, too. These images make it straightforward to display complex information in an accessible way. They can help explain processes, display statistics, and illustrate the benefits of your&nbsp;product.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-keep-forms-short-and-simple \" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Keep forms short and simple&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<p>No one wants to have to spend several minutes completing a complex form. That’s why keeping yours short and simple can help boost the conversion rate on your landing page. This won’t necessarily apply to every industry, where some might need to capture a great deal of information to do business together&nbsp;properly.</p>\n\n\n<p>For most, however, keeping the number of fields on your forms limited is a wise choice. Try to keep it all on one screen, too. Multistep forms can be effective in fields where you have complex data collection needs, but a straightforward 3-4 field form is still typically best.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that each form field has a clear, concise label that indicates what information is required, and make use of inline validation. This provides real-time feedback to people as they fill out the form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature helps users correct errors immediately and increases the likelihood of form completion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://akismet.com/talk-to-sales/\">Akismet enterprise</a> contact page offers a solid example of an effective landing page contact form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"Akismet form with just a few fields\" class=\"wp-image-284077\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It asks for straightforward, relevant information without being overwhelming. There’s just enough questions to segment submissions without plummeting conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-avoid-using captcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Avoid using&nbsp;CAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-captcha/\">CAPTCHAs are commonly used to prevent spam</a> and bot submissions on forms, but they can also create friction and frustration for genuine users. Any added friction in the conversion process can lead to an increased bounce rate. So, skipping the CAPTCHA on your landing page forms is the best approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Beyond the UX inconvenience they pose, CAPTCHAs also present accessibility issues and can be quite problematic for those with disabilities. Visually impaired people may find it challenging to complete visual CAPTCHAs, while audio CAPTCHAs may not be effective in noisy environments or for those with hearing impairments. A less accessible, inclusive website can make for a knock to your brand’s reputation, a lack of compliance with accessibility standards, and reduced conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.jpeg\" alt=\"information about Akismet\'s features\" class=\"wp-image-284078\" />\n\n\n<p>All that said, you still don’t want to be inundated with spam. Thankfully, there’s a better way to prevent this kind of&nbsp;annoyance.</p>\n\n\n<p>Instead of relying on CAPTCHAs, using <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a> is an effective, cost-efficient solution. Akismet’s powerful spam filtering service can automatically detect and block spam submissions without requiring any user interaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used on over 100 million sites, Akismet works continuously in the background without slowing down your site, and it boasts a 99.99% accuracy rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-focus-on benefits\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Focus on&nbsp;benefits</h2>\n\n\n<p>Though mentioned in passing in a few of the points previously, prioritizing benefits warrants its own item on this list. It can’t be overstated how important focusing on benefits of your product or service is — especially in contrast to just listing features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benefits explain how the features improve your customer’s life, solve their problems, or fulfill their needs. A list of features doesn’t do any of this, as it doesn’t offer the “why”. A benefits-focus, however, is compelling and relatable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re stumped on where to begin with this, try translating each of your product or service’s features into a clear, user-centric benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, instead of just stating &#8220;Our software has automated reporting&#8221;, you might say, &#8220;Save hours of manual work every week with our software&#8217;s automated reporting. This allows you to focus on the big picture&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasize your unique selling points, too. They should be framed as benefits that set your product apart from the competition. Why is your product the best choice?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you sell solar panels, you might say, &#8220;Our solar panels are designed to withstand extreme weather conditions, providing reliable energy production year-round.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-include-video testimonials\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Include video&nbsp;testimonials</h2>\n\n\n<p>You can boost landing page conversion rates by incorporating video testimonials into your content as well. These videos act as social proof by showcasing real customers who have benefited from your product or service. When your claims can be backed up by real customers’ words, your USPs become much more convincing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to use real customers in your video testimonials to provide authenticity and relatability. Genuine experiences from actual users are much more convincing than scripted or generic endorsements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encourage those who provide testimonials to be specific and results-oriented in their commentary. Did your product make their workflow more efficient? Did they save money? Be sure the benefits and outcomes are emphasized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the content of the testimonial is most important, good production quality can enhance the credibility and professionalism of the video as well. Good lighting, clear audio, and a stable camera setup never hurts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instrumentl.com/customers\">Instrumentl</a>, a grant finding tool and non-profit, has a dedicated customer stories landing page with video testimonials prominently displayed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"585\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Instrumentl homepage\" class=\"wp-image-284079\" />\n\n\n<h2 id=\"9-highlight-social-proof-to-build credibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Highlight social proof to build&nbsp;credibility</h2>\n\n<p>Video testimonials are an example of social proof, but there’s more to it than just that. Social proof offers a direct way to boost your landing page&#8217;s credibility and encourage conversions. It makes use of the influence of others to validate your product or service. This makes potential customers more likely to trust your brand because they’re hearing from past&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n<p>Customer testimonials provide first&#8209;hand accounts of users’ positive experiences with your company. Featuring quotes — written or video — can go a long way to encourage the&nbsp;sale.</p>\n\n<p>In&#8209;depth case studies are another solid approach here. You can use them to showcase detailed examples of how your product or service has solved specific problems. These narratives often include before&#8209;and&#8209;after scenarios to demonstrate measurable results and concrete&nbsp;benefits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"10-use-trust signals\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Use trust&nbsp;signals</h2>\n\n\n<p>Trust signals are little design elements or phrases you can add to your landing page that reassure visitors about the credibility and safety of your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can show trust badges and certifications from reputable organizations to further reassure site visitors of your credibility. Things like industry awards and memberships apply here, as do things like a badge stating you’re a <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/get-accredited\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BBB Accredited Business</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Security badges from reputable organizations indicate that your website is safe and secure for transactions, too. Common examples include SSL certificates and <a href=\"https://www.trustedsite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TrustedSite</a>. Displaying these badges near forms and payment sections can add that bit of extra reassurance customers need to&nbsp;convert.</p>\n\n\n<p>Other trust signals relate to how you do business. Offering a money-back guarantee can significantly reduce the perceived risk of purchasing your product or service. The same goes for posting clear and fair return and refund policies. Putting these in an accessible location indicates your company is customer-centric and willing to address any issues that arise post-purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Displaying user reviews and ratings from third-party sites such as Google, Yelp, or industry-specific review platforms can add a layer of authenticity and trust, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also display client and partner logos on your landing page to serve as quick endorsements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lastly, providing clear and accessible contact information, such as a phone number, email address, and physical address, can increase trust,&nbsp;too.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cultureamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Culture Amp</a> offers a solid example of many of these trust signals in action. They pack in many of them above-the-fold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5.jpeg\" alt=\"CultureAmp homepage\" class=\"wp-image-284080\" />\n\n\n<p>You can see past client logos, contact information, and ratings on reviews sites at a glance&nbsp;here.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"11-anticipate-and-address-common objections\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Anticipate and address common&nbsp;objections</h2>\n\n\n<p>Having a clear idea of where your potential customers are coming from and doing your best to mitigate their concerns can go a long way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, you’ll need to identify the most common objections your potential customers might have. This could include concerns about price, product effectiveness, ease of use, customer support, and return policies. You can reach out to people on social media to ask about their concerns directly to gather this information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Then, you can create an FAQ section to answer the most common objections. That way, when a prospect lands on your site, they’ll have their questions answered without having to contact you. The less effort a potential customer has to put in to come to a purchasing decision, the&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n<p>Providing clear pricing can help, too. There’s nothing worse for a customer than arriving at the checkout screen to realize hidden fees have been added to the purchase&nbsp;price.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"12-use-clear-calls-to-action cta\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Use clear calls to action&nbsp;(CTA)</h2>\n\n\n<p>A clear and compelling call-to-action is your landing page’s make-or-break moment. It’s the last bit people see before they decide to convert (or not).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most of your final push to encourage prospects to become customers, be sure to use strong, action-oriented verbs that clearly tell visitors what they need to do. Phrases like &#8220;Get Started&#8221;, &#8220;Download Now&#8221;, &#8220;Sign Up Today&#8221;, and &#8220;Claim Your Free Trial&#8221; are direct and encourage immediate action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also incorporate a sense of urgency into your CTA to prompt visitors to act quickly. Phrases such as &#8220;Limited Time Offer&#8221;, &#8220;Only a Few Left&#8221;, or &#8220;Register Before It’s Too Late&#8221; can create a sense of scarcity and encourage immediate action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any CTA you present should stand out visually on the page. Use a contrasting color that draws attention and ensures the button doesn’t blend in with the rest of the content. Make it stand out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don’t be afraid to include supporting text around your CTA as well. Such text provides additional context and reassurance. For example, adding a short phrase like &#8220;No credit card required&#8221; or &#8220;Free for the first 30 days&#8221; can alleviate concerns <em>and</em> make the offer more enticing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> offers a to-the-point CTA that’s upfront and hard to ignore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6.jpeg\" alt=\"Dropbox page with big blue button\" class=\"wp-image-284081\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The “Find your plan” button sounds non-committal but ultimately a great way to entice people to sign up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"13-incorporate-directional cues\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Incorporate directional&nbsp;cues</h2>\n\n\n<p>Any visual element that guides a site visitor&#8217;s attention to critical parts of your landing page could be considered a directional cue. Often, you’ll find them pointing to key page elements like the CTA or a contact form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrows are one of the most straightforward and effective directional cues. And by having them point to your CTA, you’re drawing the visitor’s eye to it and making it clear that’s where they should click next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, lines or pathways can subtly guide the user&#8217;s gaze through the page as well. You want to lead them on a journey that ends with interacting with your CTA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But arrows and lines aren’t the only directional cues you can use. Images of people qualify as well. Photos where the subject within is looking in the direction of your CTA is an effective choice, too. For instance, a photograph of a person looking toward a &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button can direct people’s attention to that area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"14-harness-urgency-and scarcity\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Harness urgency and&nbsp;scarcity</h2>\n\n\n<p>Another way to boost landing page conversion rates is by compelling visitors to act quickly. These psychological triggers leverage the fear of missing out (FOMO), which can be a powerful motivator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can activate FOMO by making deals available for only a limited time. When a discount or promotion is available for a short period, people may be more likely to act immediately and complete the purchase. You can clearly display the time limit with countdown timers to make the deadline visible and tangible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon does a good job of this, with their red “Limited time deal” flags on products available at a temporary discount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon limited time deal red banner\" class=\"wp-image-284082\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Including low stock notices on product pages leans into this sense of scarcity as well. Or, you could offer an exclusive deal to a subgroup of your customer base — like email subscribers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can further add to this sense of urgency and scarcity by adding real-time notifications to your site. These notifications will let customers know how many people are viewing a particular item — or how many of an item is still in stock.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"15-practice-risk reversal\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Practice risk&nbsp;reversal</h2>\n\n\n<p>Risk reversal plays into the trust signals discussed previously, but it warrants its own callout here. This tactic involves offering guarantees or assurances that reduce the perceived risk for potential customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The best example of risk reversal in action is offering a money&#8209;back guarantee. This offer assures customers that if they are not satisfied with the product or service, they can get a full refund. And when implemented clearly and well, this can reduce purchase hesitation. State the terms of this guarantee upfront and prominently, such as &#8220;30&#8209;day money&#8209;back guarantee&#8221; or &#8220;Satisfaction guaranteed or your money&nbsp;back&#8221;.​</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for free trials. This offer lets customers try your product or service before committing to a purchase. This is usually a great choice for software products, subscription services, and digital products. To promote this, you might say, &#8220;14&#8209;day free trial with no credit card&nbsp;required.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Along with a money&#8209;back guarantee and a free trial, you could also provide a hassle&#8209;free return and exchange policy as well as warranties, when&nbsp;applicable.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com\">Warby Parker</a> has an impressive free trial offer — you can test out five different eye-glasses frames at home without spending a penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png\" alt=\"Warby Parker landing page\" class=\"wp-image-284083\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This offer is mentioned above the fold on the homepage, making it tempting to new customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"16-make-sure-your-pages-are-responsive-and-mobile optimized\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Make sure your pages are responsive and mobile&nbsp;optimized</h2>\n\n\n<p>It might sound like a small thing, as it’s an expected part of web design nowadays, but ensuring your landing page is responsive and mobile-optimized is a must, too. Offering a seamless mobile experience for prospective customers improves UX and engagement, which means more conversions for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On mobile devices, your site should prioritize a clean and straightforward menu structure that’s accessible. A common approach is the &#8220;hamburger&#8221; menu, which expands when tapped. Ensure that key elements like your CTA are prominently displayed and easily accessible without requiring excessive scrolling​, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep links touch-friendly, too. And before you launch your landing page, be sure to test it across multiple devices and screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"17-ensure-your-site-loads-quickly \" class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Ensure your site loads quickly&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paying attention to loading speeds can help keep your landing page conversion-ready. Pages that are too slow to load can cause visitors to get frustrated and bounce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Knowing this, following best practices for improving site speed is imperative. You’ll want to pay attention to things like compressing images, making use of browser caching, and minimizing HTTP requests. You’ll also need to minify your code and use a CDN to reduce overall latency at the server level. Tools like <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> can help you identify and address&nbsp;issues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"18-consider-color psychology\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Consider color&nbsp;psychology</h2>\n\n\n<p>Another way you can improve your landing page conversion rate is by using color psychology. This is a time-honored approach in marketing that can help you effectively influence visitors&#8217; emotions and actions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/color-psychology-color-meanings\">Oberlo</a>, here are some colors and their typical psychological associations. This information could help you get a handle on how your color choices can influence the ways customers feel (and act):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Red</strong> creates urgency and excitement. It’s a good color for CTA buttons and limited&#8209;time&nbsp;offers.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Blue </strong>conveys trust and calmness. This is great for finance, healthcare, and technology&nbsp;brands.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Green</strong> is associated with growth and harmony. Green is suitable for environmental products and health&nbsp;brands.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong> makes people feel optimistic. It’s effective as an accent color to highlight important&nbsp;information.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> conveys a sense of confidence. This is good for CTA buttons and&nbsp;banners.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Purple</strong> represents luxury and creativity. Purple is ideal for high&#8209;end and innovative&nbsp;products.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Black</strong> conveys sophistication. Black is often used for luxury brands as&nbsp;well.</li>\n\n<li><strong>White</strong> symbolizes simplicity. It’s great for backgrounds to create space and&nbsp;clarity.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>You’ll want to make use of contrasting colors to make important elements like CTA buttons stand out as&nbsp;well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"19-offer comparisons\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Offer&nbsp;comparisons</h2>\n\n<p>If you are confident in your product or service’s ability to outperform the competition, offering direct comparisons can be a solid selling point. And in doing so, you can highlight your unique advantages and convince potential customers to choose&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n<p>While you can simply write up comparisons as body copy, a comparison table can be helpful for those skimming through your landing page for pertinent information. In it, you’ll want to list features, pricing, benefits, and other relevant factors side by side to make it simple for visitors to see where you excel. Ensure that the table is clear, concise, and legible,&nbsp;too.​</p>\n\n\n<p>Be honest in your comparisons, however. Highlighting your strengths is essential, but avoid misrepresenting or downplaying competitors if your statements are false.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"20-promote-lead magnets\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Promote lead&nbsp;magnets</h2>\n\n\n<p>Offering a lead magnet is another great way to attract attention and convert prospects into customers. Lead magnets are valuable resources offered for free to visitors in exchange for their contact information, typically an email address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering any old piece of content for free won’t do, however. A successful lead magnet addresses a specific problem or offers a solution that your audience finds valuable. So long as it achieves this goal, the type of content you offer could be pretty much anything. Popular types of lead magnets include things like eBooks, checklists, access to webinars or workshops, templates, or even free samples.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png\" alt=\"WPVIP form with a lead capture\" class=\"wp-image-284084\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress VIP, in exchange for filling out a simple form, offers a 2024 report on how content drives growth. This is a great lead magnet, as it’s directly applicable to the types of enterprise businesses that might use their services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"21-be-consistent-in-design-and message\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Be consistent in design and&nbsp;message</h2>\n\n\n<p>No matter your industry, presenting a consistent design and message is another key component for successful landing pages. A clear and consistent brand conveys trust helps with recall..&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s convenient to say “be consistent” but the truth is, you need to approach the design and message with a clear plan — from the start. That means developing comprehensive brand guidelines that outline your brand’s visual and verbal identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These guidelines should include things like how and when your logo should be used (including size, spacing, and color variations), your site’s color palette, the typography used, the types of images (illustrations or photos), and the tone of voice of your content. Once you have these guidelines in place, you can make sure your content adheres to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stripe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stripe</a> does a good job of this on its website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-8.jpeg\" alt=\"Stripe landing page with a colorful background\" class=\"wp-image-284085\" />\n\n\n<p>It prioritizes purple and blue colors, dynamic animations, and a confident&nbsp;voice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"22-make-accessibility-a priority\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Make accessibility a&nbsp;priority</h2>\n\n\n<p>You’ll also want to ensure your landing page is accessible to people with disabilities. This isn’t just a legal requirement, but also an essential part of reaching everyone with an optimal user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways to ensure accessibility, including the use of semantic HTML, which provides meaningful markup that helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of your content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need to provide text alternatives for images, videos, and audio files. Use alt attributes for images to describe their content. For complex images like charts, provide a detailed description in the surrounding text. And transcribing video and audio content (and offering closed captions for videos)​ goes a long way,&nbsp;too.</p>\n\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> is your best bet for making sure you cover all aspects of web accessibility, from ARIA landmarks to keyboard&nbsp;accessibility</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"23-offer-live-chat-for-personalized assistance\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Offer live chat for personalized&nbsp;assistance</h2>\n\n\n<p>One way to really make your landing page stand out is to offer live chat. Providing real-time, personalized assistance makes it so you’re addressing customer questions the moment they arise. You can resolve issues and guide visitors through the decision-making process immediately. When you provide timely help like this, you’ll boost conversions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use proactive chat invitations to engage visitors who may need assistance but haven’t initiated a chat yet. For example, if someone spends a decent chunk of time on a product page or is about to exit, a chat popup can appear asking if they need help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you have a WordPress site, a WooCommerce extension like <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/livechat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LiveChat for WooCommerce</a> can help you field customer questions in real time in a way that’s integrated with your broader store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"24-ab test\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. A/B&nbsp;test</h2>\n\n\n<p>The last recommended tactic for improving your landing page conversion rate is to A/B test everything. Split testing involves comparing two versions of your landing page, each with a single element slightly different, to determine which one performs better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common elements to prioritize in A/B testing include headlines, CTA buttons, image choices, color schemes, copy, and layout variations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your element selected, you can then create two or more variations of the element you want to test. For instance, if you are testing headlines, write multiple versions that highlight different benefits or use different tones. Then, compare them over a set period of time. The one that encourages a better conversion rate is the winner. Then you can move on to test a different element.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>To run a test like this, you’ll need to split your website traffic. There are tons of tools out there to facilitate this, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com\">Optimizely</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that we’ve explored multiple ways to optimize your landing pages and improve their conversion rates, take some time to browse through some frequently asked questions about this process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-designing-a-landing page\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the common mistakes to avoid when designing a landing&nbsp;page?</h3>\n\n<p>Common mistakes to avoid when designing a landing page include a cluttered design, an unclear CTA, slow loading times, a lack of mobile optimization, and not addressing visitor pain points. You’ll need to speak directly to your target audience and provide an accessible and user&#8209;friendly on&#8209;site experience to see improved conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-good-conversion-rate-for-a-landing page\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a good conversion rate for a landing&nbsp;page?</h3>\n\n<p>A good conversion rate varies by industry. But for landing pages in general, a good conversion rate is 2&#8209;5%. However, top&#8209;performing landing pages can achieve conversion rates of 10% or higher​, especially if the industry is very&nbsp;specific.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-use-captcha-to-protect-my-form-from spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should I use CAPTCHA to protect my form from&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>While CAPTCHA can prevent spam, it can also deter genuine site visitors from converting. So, no, you shouldn’t use CAPTCHA and should opt for an alternative like Akismet. This <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">anti&#8209;spam alternative to CAPTCHA</a> offers effective spam protection without compromising the user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-akismet-and-how-can-it-improve-my-lead-generation-form-conversion rate\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet, and how can it improve my lead generation form conversion&nbsp;rate?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is a powerful spam&#8209;filtering service that automatically detects and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">blocks spam submissions</a>. And it doesn’t rely on CAPTCHA to do it. This means users have fewer steps to complete forms, thus improving conversion rates without leading to an increase in&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is trusted by over 100 million sites, including enterprise brands like Microsoft, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a>, and Bluehost. Akismet provides effective spam protection that doesn’t impede on lead generation efforts, offering a win&#8209;win scenario for companies of all&nbsp;sizes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-often-should-i-update-or-tweak-my-landing-page-for-optimal performance\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How often should I update or tweak my landing page for optimal&nbsp;performance?</h3>\n\n\n<p>You should update or tweak your landing page on a regular basis. Aim to review and make changes to your landing page at least quarterly, or more frequently if you notice a drop in performance metrics or significant changes in user behavior. Keeping an eye on metrics and conducting regular A/B tests can help mitigate sudden increases in bounce rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-lead-magnet-and-how-can-it-boost-my-landing-page conversions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a lead magnet, and how can it boost my landing page&nbsp;conversions?</h3>\n\n\n<p>A lead magnet is a valuable resource offered for free in exchange for contact information. Popular types of lead magnets include eBooks, checklists, and reports. The most effective lead magnets attract and convert visitors by providing immediate value. This then inserts the prospect into your sales funnel, which means they’re primed and ready to make a purchase later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-key-metrics-to-track-when-analyzing-landing-page performance\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the key metrics to track when analyzing landing page&nbsp;performance?</h3>\n\n\n<p>When tracking and analyzing landing page performance, you should keep an eye on its conversion rate, bounce rate, average time on page, click-through rate (CTR), and cost per conversion. Tracking these metrics helps identify areas for improvement and measure the effectiveness of the optimizations you make.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-optimizing-a-landing page\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some common mistakes to avoid when optimizing a landing&nbsp;page?</h3>\n\n\n<p>When optimizing a landing page, you’ll want to avoid common mistakes like making too many changes at once, which makes it impossible to see how individual changes are affecting performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Another mistake is ignoring mobile visitors. Any landing page created in 2024 should be optimized for mobile interaction by default. Also, not aligning the page with user intent or addressing customer pain points are big&nbsp;issues.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"Do The Woo Community: Bridging Art and Blockchain, Bringing Certification to Woo with Robert Norton\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84943\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://dothewoo.io/bridging-art-and-blockchain-bringing-certification-to-woo-with-robert-norton/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38914:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-45 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-44 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-41 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-17 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-40 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Omnisend-square.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78802\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-18\"><strong><a href=\"https://your.omnisend.com/onlywoo_dothewoo\">Omnisend</a></strong>: Whether it&#8217;s for integration into your Woo product, or building sites for clients, <strong>Omnisend</strong> is the solution for email and SMS marketing with their CRM solution for WooCommerce shops and your own website.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-10 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-43 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-19 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-42 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1224\" height=\"1224\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hostinger_Vertical_Purple-e1668465093968.jpg?resize=1224%2C1224&ssl=1\" alt=\"Hostinger\" class=\"wp-image-73505\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-20\"><strong><a href=\"https://hostinger.com\">Hostinger</a></strong>: As a builder or an agency managing multiple sites, check out <strong>Hostinger</strong>.

We&#8217;re talking Emerging Tech, and today we&#8217;re talking with Robert Norton from Verisart. Hi Robert, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Good. Great to be here. Thanks for having me on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />No worries. And I should probably say I&#8217;m your host, Dave Lockie as well. So I guess a bit about you, Robert. You&#8217;re the CEO and founder of Verisart. What came before that and what&#8217;s your journey been like as an entrepreneur?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />For the last 15 years, I found myself at the intersection of art and tech. Prior to Verisart, which is a platform that started doing blockchain certification for the art and collectibles market, I was running a company called Sedition Art, which was, in a way, one of the first platforms that sold digital limited editions by well-known artists. Now, of course, we come to know digital limited editions as non-fungible tokens and NFTs, which I know we&#8217;re going to get into later. But it was my time at Sedition between 2010 to 2013 that really got me thinking about how artists can find new audiences in other mediums. The principal medium of most of the artists we worked with at Sedition was physical, not digital. Prior to that, I was the founder and CEO of Saatchi Art, previously known as Saatchi Online. We turned it into an e-commerce enabled platform where artists who didn&#8217;t have any gallery representation could have a platform to show their work and sell directly to consumers. So, we did a lot of that heavy lifting for them. In some ways, it&#8217;s analogous perhaps to Etsy, but with more focus on independent working artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess why did I end up in this sort of strange intersection? Probably because, in the back of my mind, I wanted to do something in the art world. Both my parents did art degrees, my grandfather was a restorer, so I grew up in a household where the idea of unauthorized or authorized reproductions was quite prevalent. You&#8217;d often see, in the case of 19th-century works, studios like Joshua Reynolds would have many works of the same coming from the studio, some of which just worked on by his studio, some of which he worked on in parts, and some of which he worked on entirely. This area of multiples was really interesting to me. The aha moment with Verisart was looking at the case of the Knoedler Gallery, which came to the press around 2015. One of the oldest galleries in New York was found guilty of selling fake Rothkos, a well-known post-war artist in the states, selling these works by the dozen in modern times, in 2015. It wasn&#8217;t just unwitting people that should know better, but people like the chairman of Sotheby&#8217;s themselves. I was thinking this is a real problem when you have such trust in authorities that are clearly not able to be trusted. I thought about how to improve trust with the advent of distributed ledger technology. We&#8217;ve been tackling that problem now for almost 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you a little insight before that, I started my career back in &#8217;95 at America Online, initially in business development, then running e-commerce, and then did a bunch of startups from health to games. I was the person that launched King.com in North America. So, I was the first managing director for King.com in North America. My whole career has been in consumer-facing e-commerce, as I would describe it. While we&#8217;re not a marketplace at Verisart, we do help people with their drops and their releases. We&#8217;ve now started offering a token gate app print service, which takes us closer to revenue-generating opportunities for artists as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Amazing. What strikes me about your founding story is that this was not just a love of art, but a very personal relationship with art. It was all around you, with artists and with people who were trying to make a living with art, the artists themselves, the people around that industry, the restorers, the galleries, the marketplaces. This is obviously a very deeply connected and personal mission for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I think Steve Jobs said, you can connect the dots looking backwards, but you don&#8217;t necessarily connect them moving forwards. I didn&#8217;t necessarily feel it as personally, but now I think it makes sense. My wife also has a gallery that we work with, and I met my wife through my interest in art. So, I guess we&#8217;re very much an art family at this point. But really, it was the advent of blockchain technology that inspired me to do this business. One of the artists we worked with at my former company, Sedition Art, is Casey Reas. Casey is also the co-inventor, along with Ben Fry, of a language called Processing, which enabled artists to generate their digital art with a rules-based programming language. It was Casey who wrote to me in 2014 and said, &#8220;Hey Robert, looking at what you&#8217;re doing at Saatchi Online and Sedition Art, I think this technology has real potential for certification of verification purposes, both for physical and digital art.&#8221; That got me thinking about how blockchains work, mechanisms to trust a timeline, and commitments to that timeline. It felt like a good application for some of the problems we were facing with our provenance certification. In a nutshell, we were taking the certificate, typically issued by some sort of authority, maybe an estate, studio, or gallery, and the provenance, which is another fancy word for the story—the agreed story around the history of that object. That may include exhibition literature as well. We were taking the registry—who&#8217;s ultimately responsible—and binding the certificate, provenance, and registry together by shared distributed ledger technology standards. I think it makes for a stronger provenance. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing at Verisart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, really interesting. Maybe you could talk to us about what that journey&#8217;s looked like. Has it been one with a lot of pivoting, large or small, or has it been more a case of feeling like you&#8217;ve got the right solution, but the job is to educate, make aware, and onboard? How would you describe that 10 years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Ten years ago, a small percentage of households owned crypto, and now we&#8217;re well into double digits, depending on certain age groups. I think it&#8217;s up to 40% in some age groups. As a whole, it&#8217;s about 20% or so of households in the US that now own crypto in one form or another. We&#8217;ve come a long way, and sometimes people talk about the number of households that own crypto paralleling the growth in the number of households that went online in the early days of internet service providers and online services. Whether those correlate correctly, the point is that we&#8217;ve grown from a very small base to something that feels closer to mainstream, although it&#8217;s not yet at mainstream levels of adoption. We&#8217;re not past a 50% threshold in most markets, except for a few perhaps like El Salvador, where Bitcoin&#8217;s become an alternative national currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could characterize what it was like in 2014, I was at this Scaling Bitcoin conference at Stanford University. There were literally probably about 200 people in the community that then went on to build aspects of the blockchain infrastructure we&#8217;re familiar with today. That was probably the size of the industry for well-known players at that point. It was very small, and even at conferences, you would struggle to get more than a thousand people to show up. Now we&#8217;ve got huge conferences from DeFi to NFTs to staking, to wallet providers, new L1s, which is layer one blockchains, new roll-ups, and L2s. The industry has really evolved. Back in 2014, 2015, I spent most of my time explaining what a blockchain was and why the words art and blockchain were in the same sentence. Now, because of the NFT boom and bust we witnessed in 2021, no one really questions why the words art and blockchain go together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way in terms of people&#8217;s understanding of what this technology can do, but we&#8217;re still set back by the early years in terms of the bad actors in the space. We&#8217;ve seen arrests of the principals of FTX and Binance, and bad actors erode consumer trust. That&#8217;s very unhelpful when you&#8217;re trying to bring new technologies to market. In some ways, it was like two steps forward, one step back, but we&#8217;ve really come a long way over the last 10 years. As a result, we can start focusing more on the applications and less on explaining what&#8217;s beneath the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />And I think because there&#8217;s such a visual representation—maybe the only visual representation of crypto technology that most people can find—it has that artistic element to it. There have been a lot of bad actors, and the worlds where art and finance meet are often murky and gray anyway. When you accelerate that with the petrol of the internet, there have been a lot of problematic NFT projects. I can imagine that&#8217;s been particularly challenging for you. You&#8217;re certainly right, there are lots of data points, but the trend line is increasing adoption, increasing awareness. Now you mentioned this idea about mainstream, and one of the conversations I hear in crypto is that crypto will be mainstream when people are using it without knowing that it&#8217;s crypto. I noticed that at Verisart you take a very deliberately technology-inclusive approach to describing what you do. How often do you find yourself in a situation where you&#8217;re trying to explain Verisart to somebody who is utterly naive and ignorant to crypto and blockchain? Do you ever find success in converting those merchants or artists, or is this always a more progressive and educational sell where they have to get some foundations before they can see the value in what you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We&#8217;ve got a good history of working with artists, and we were one of the first external curators on SuperRare, which is a well-known premium platform for unique digital artwork. So one-of-ones is what they&#8217;re often referred to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>. Back in 2021, because of my time at Sedition, where we worked with many well-known artists from Damien Hirst to Bill Viola to Tracey Emin and Shepard Fairey, Christian Boltanski, Yoko Ono, we probably worked with a hundred of the world&#8217;s top contemporary artists during my time at Sedition. It&#8217;s still continuing to this day. That experience of speaking to an artist and understanding what they want to release as a digital edition, can we help them, have they got the facilities to do it in-house themselves—this discussion was more complex during the NFT boom and bust because there were things like needing a wallet, a smart contract, and deciding under which smart contract to mint. But we were able to have those discussions because we understood the issues ourselves. We&#8217;ve done a huge number of inaugural artists&#8217; NFTs. Whether it&#8217;s Roe Ethridge, William Wegman, Shepard Fairey, Petra Cortright, or Neil Beloufa, a lot of well-known artists&#8217; inaugural NFTs. They came to us because they were somewhat confused by this landscape and they wanted somebody they could trust to guide them through the process. We did two drops with SuperRare, 10 by 10 and 8 by 8, focused on inaugural artists&#8217; NFTs. We also did Artsy&#8217;s first NFT drop in early 2022, which included 22 artists. So, we&#8217;re absolutely in the business of handholding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to looking for our audience and the actual users of our service—the SaaS users or the people that are subscribed to our software—we&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s very hard work dragging someone along to the drinking trough. It&#8217;s better if they&#8217;re already there by the waterside and you can perhaps help them more effectively. We&#8217;re not so much in the business of telling people they need to use blockchain technology, but more in the business of explaining how we can provide a good service for people who are already looking in that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Cool. Yeah, that makes sense. As a small business, you have to focus on what&#8217;s achievable within your resources and timescales. I&#8217;m sure a lot of the awareness work you&#8217;re doing is going to have a knock-on effect further down into the future, but you certainly have to be judicious with the way you&#8217;re putting that target of energy. One thing I think about quite a lot, and this is with NFTs generally, not just art-based NFTs—of course, there&#8217;s some philosophical conversation about what is and isn&#8217;t art—whenever you use a new medium or format for art, it brings new constraints and opportunities creatively. With digital, it allowed for, for example, algorithmic generative art. However, then when you take digital art and put it on-chain, that also changes the format and the medium. What I&#8217;m thinking about here is the public nature of interaction with that art—who minted it, who collected it, has it been sold on secondary, what&#8217;s the price trend, all of that. My question is, to what extent is that interesting and exciting and offering new opportunities to artists where they may have had glimpses of that historically, seeing their art for sale or auction or whatever, but now they have this opportunity to be directly in communication with people that hold their art because if you both have wallets, there are plenty of ways to contact each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />There&#8217;s a lot to unpack there. The first is, obviously, art is now as easily tradable an asset as an NFT, as the fungible token—Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, or Tezos. These chains are in the business of minting coins and having people speculate on the value of those coins and the value those networks will accumulate. Remember, they all sit within the same type of wallets. That was never the case with art before. You had a painting, it may have been an asset, but it didn&#8217;t sit within your bank account, and you could trade it like you could trade pounds, dollars, or euros. You&#8217;re absolutely right to bring that up first. What the blockchain did, and particularly NFTs, is it basically meant that all the digital art released as NFTs were now effectively like financial instruments. That&#8217;s why you suddenly saw crazy amounts of speculation and wash trading, and activities that created these elevated floor prices for works that were sold or given away. The use of CryptoPunks or Bored Apes in these 10K drops became the symbol of the height of the market, where algorithms were spinning out 10,000 different variations of a theme. They were sorted by traits—certain rare backgrounds, shapes on their heads, laser eyes, etc. Artists started to use traits around art, and it became very confusing for a lot of people to determine what is art and what is just PFP—a personal profile picture. Some of these also became very valuable assets like the Punks and Apes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s all now beginning to shake out. The challenges for artists probably outweigh the opportunities because artists get exhausted by having to maintain a constant dialogue with their community. The community can turn on them if the financial returns go down. It puts a lot of pressure and stress on the artists. Traditionally, artists have had dealers to remove some of their need to be there talking to their collectors. Healthy, protective art communities exist. The Art Blocks community, which we work with closely, and the generative art community are small and protective of one another. That&#8217;s a good example of a healthier discourse, but it&#8217;s not completely removed from those who just want to speculate on digital art as an asset and feel disappointed when prices don&#8217;t go their way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing is that art is now more of a tradable instrument than it was. It attracts speculators, and speculators outweigh collectors. We&#8217;ve seen that with the rise of marketplaces that don&#8217;t enforce artist royalties. That&#8217;s symptomatic of more speculators than collectors still in the market. We&#8217;re currently doing a show at Gazelli Art House called &#8220;Awaken and Metamagical Hands,&#8221; which includes pioneers like John Maeda, Golan Levin, Joshua Davis, and Leah, as well as younger artists like Robbie Barrat and Lauren Lee McCarthy. All these artists could have solo shows themselves, but they&#8217;re still trying to understand the role of algorithms in their relationship to others or even to themselves. Lauren Lee McCarthy, a professor at UCLA and the Design Media and Arts lab along with Casey Reas, has created an installation called &#8220;Saliva Exchange,&#8221; where people can come in and spit in a vial, write a few things about their saliva, and share it with someone else. It&#8217;s a conceptual piece addressing questions around the way algorithms are based in life and how that changes our interactions and notions of modern-day intimacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different artists are exploring different digital trends—some using midjourney or OpenAI algorithms for generative video and art, others building their own software, and others focusing on conceptual fields. It&#8217;s an interesting time. However, the principal responsibility of an artist is to create art, not to pump their communities. Those artists who shot to fame by pumping their communities may not be the ones that last from a museum or historical standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, interesting. Digital and blockchain art has been extremely disruptive, and that disruption continues. There are some emerging trends—very art-focused communities that are positive and nurturing, and people pushing the boundaries of generative and on-chain art. There&#8217;s still a lot more emergence to happen. Let&#8217;s switch gears a bit. We&#8217;ve mainly talked about art and blockchain so far. I&#8217;d like to bring this back down to earth for a Woo audience. We may have merchants listening who are selling art or interested in how they can use NFTs to enhance what they&#8217;re doing with e-commerce. We almost certainly have agency folks who would love to get their teams working with some of these technologies. They&#8217;re thinking about which of their clients might want to use this technology, what success looks like, etc. We talked about art being wrapped in these digital tokens. Digital assets are tokenized and put into common digital wallets. This extends to real-world assets as well—cases of wine, physical artwork, fractions of an old Mercedes, etc. If you&#8217;re just issuing NFTs and transacting on-chain, you don&#8217;t need a traditional e-commerce setup because you can do this through marketplaces. The whole idea is that you don&#8217;t need fulfillment because it&#8217;s all digital. You don&#8217;t need a traditional payment processor and checkout because it&#8217;s all based on wallet signatures and digital asset transfers. Yet, there is a lot of e-commerce happening where you do need e-commerce—you need to take delivery, accept orders, worry about tax and payments, and everything else. Where do those two worlds intersect? What does a merchant or a success story look like where you get those two things? Verisart operates in both purely digital and intersectional worlds through integrations with WooCommerce and Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s super helpful when the certification is happening at the time of sale because otherwise, if you&#8217;re creating certificates on Verisart.com and doing your sale through some other mechanism, there&#8217;s always going to be a lag between the sale, the invoice happening on some platform—whether it&#8217;s your own, a third-party marketplace, or offline. We&#8217;ve always felt it&#8217;s helpful to close that gap in time for the certification at the time of transaction. With NFTs, you can mint and list the NFT later, but mostly people mint and sell the NFT at the same time. In the early years of Verisart, when we didn&#8217;t have any e-commerce integrations, people used us, but we didn&#8217;t see enough transfers of the certificates. We wanted to make that easier for people. About five years ago, we did our first app with Shopify. We&#8217;re super happy to have launched our WooCommerce app this year. We&#8217;ve learned a lot from our time on the other marketplace platform in terms of building a good app from day one with the WooCommerce audience. Our app allows people to certify products, whether physical or digital. We support minting NFTs or tokens. One thing we don&#8217;t support is fractions of an object because once you start offering fractions, you&#8217;re into the world of securities regulation, which we stay well clear of. Also, fractionalizing an artwork isn&#8217;t necessarily where there&#8217;s real demand for fractionalized opportunities. Fractionalizing businesses that provide you a yield or return that can be valued is more of an obvious first spot than fractionalizing an artwork because there often isn&#8217;t consensus around the price for unique artworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WooCommerce merchants, we&#8217;ve seen a big trend in collectibles and a broader definition of luxury. If you thought about luxury historically, you might think of handbags, cars, and rings, but not hoodies and sneakers. But clearly, that is part of modern-day luxury. On Verisart, if you&#8217;ve got a collectible with an authority like a living creator or a trusted business, that&#8217;s a good opportunity to improve your current certificate of authenticity with digital certification branded by your store that can be verified by new owners in real time. That&#8217;s the core of our business. We have lots of different types of businesses using our certification—from custom champagne bottles to special golf clubs to digital prints and photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example is Johnny Depp. He built a community of NFT holders and sold those NFTs through a native Web3 drop. He then wanted to give something back to those NFT holders—allowing them to have a print of their NFT. These NFTs are part of his artwork, his friends, and they look like pop-up images. There&#8217;s a need for orders, and there&#8217;s a lag between placing the order and receiving the purchase. You get out-of-the-box order management and porting. In his case, he spun up a Shopify store and used Verisart to certify his prints. When you think about merchant needs, whether they&#8217;re Web2 or Web3, Verisart helps with certifying products, physical or digital, and minting NFTs. We&#8217;ve come a long way in giving people the tooling to build their own Web3 marketplaces if they want to. Merchants that already have a significant presence through their own website might also be on Amazon. You might have a merchant with its own domain using WooCommerce but also selling on Amazon. It&#8217;s helpful to have your own URL for those digital assets to live alongside physical ones because increasingly, they have a relationship. You buy a physical asset, maybe it grants you a token, which is a form of membership. Now you are closer to that artist&#8217;s world. You might give away that token for free. We support buying a token that allows you access to purchase a print or exclusive product at a reduced cost or ahead of others. There are a lot of ways digital and physical can complement each other. Artists are experimenting with these two mediums and offering experiences together. For example, the show we&#8217;re co-curating at Gazelli Art House in London has artists using Verisart to certify their prints, and the prints are certified as NFTs. We&#8217;re constantly looking for better ways to provide merchants and creators with tools for certifying their objects, whether physical, digital, or mapping the relationship between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />I guess there&#8217;s a double-edged sword of this potentially being a tool artists can use to build and engage with their community, but not all artists. There&#8217;s nuance and unpacking to do around that for individual artists as they try to get that balance right. One thing you hinted at is that you might buy the digital token first, which gives you the right to buy a physical print or redeem it for some sort of experience later on. That fundamentally changes how art can be paid for. Instead of the artist creating art and hoping they can sell it, they can pre-sell it or fund the collection through pre-selling. Is that what the CryptoVenetians did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, we work with Bright Moments. We did the finale with them in Venice earlier this year. That&#8217;s exactly what we did. We had a poster only available to the holders of tokens from that last city, which was a thousand tokens minted during Venice, Italy, just after the Biennale this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That was such a good documentary. I can&#8217;t find it online yet, but I watched it at a screening. It was really good fun, very heartwarming. I&#8217;ve got two more questions for you, one a bit of a double-barrel. What&#8217;s the difference between a receipt and a certificate of authenticity? They both have similar attributes, right? A receipt can improve the secondary resale value of something. It has some element of proof of authenticity. I think it&#8217;s stupid we haven&#8217;t created digital infrastructure for receipts. We can spend, but we don&#8217;t get digital receipts back automatically. For example, the best way to know how healthy you&#8217;re eating is to analyze all the receipts you get from takeaways and supermarket shops. What&#8217;s the difference between a receipt and a certificate of authenticity, both in terms of the nature and what that offers in onward value?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />In the case of token-gated prints, we incorporate the order number as part of the certificate of authenticity and the token ID used along with that order number. We have patents at Verisart for handling certification. On one end, you&#8217;ve got an unverified record, where I&#8217;ve said something about an object, but no one knows who I am or if what I&#8217;ve said is true or false. It&#8217;s the lowest amount of waiting. Then we have an issuer certificate, similar to a receipt. The retailer of the object says that this thing is true. When you&#8217;ve got an artwork where the retailer is not the creator, the certificate of authenticity is where the creator has authorized that statement. Finally, we have a certificate of authenticity plus, where there&#8217;s a physical identifier on the work like a QR tag or an NFC tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core part of Verisart is that the certification can change state depending on the consensus, most importantly the creator. The problem in the past has been that the receipt is often the last thing the creator hears about. The collector gets it, but the creator might be told, &#8220;Oh, that receipt didn&#8217;t quite happen until maybe a year later, so we don&#8217;t owe you any money.&#8221; Verisart puts the creator more in control because they know when their certificates are transferred, there is a transaction out there. That&#8217;s helpful from a creator perspective. While there are similarities between receipts and certificates of authenticity, they are fundamentally different. Receipts require the issuer to be present in the future, and the issuer must remain trustworthy. One of the inspirations for Verisart was that issuers of these receipts were actually sending out fake works. The receipt was fine, but what it pointed to was fake. There are still challenges in the Web3 world with how NFTs have been construed. Transactions are correct, but what they point to may be incorrect. Verisart is actively trying to address this by building more trust at the time of transaction and ensuring the creator is present in terms of their authentication of the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFTs as COAs is interesting because even if Verisart goes away, you&#8217;ve got an on-chain record that Verisart verified and can go along with the transaction. It future-proofs your investment when those intermediaries are no longer around. A lot of merchants don&#8217;t make it past 10, 20 years, so who will determine whether that receipt is valid if the merchant can&#8217;t authorize it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, interesting. Last question, around NFT market sentiment. We went through a big boom cycle. NFTs alongside DeFi were one of the two big trends driving a lot of narrative, volumes, and arguably innovation in crypto last cycle. This cycle, while we&#8217;ve seen some things emerge and become clearer, we&#8217;ve also seen the floor prices drop significantly across many blue-chip NFTs, and there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty in the market. How do you think about that? You&#8217;re using NFTs very specifically and deliberately, rather than the popular conception of a monkey picture, but nevertheless, the broader context for NFTs must be impactful. Do you think in a year&#8217;s time we&#8217;ll be like &#8220;NFTs are so back,&#8221; or will it continue to be murky for a while longer? How do you see this sentiment resolving?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Early internet, we had titles like Director of E-Commerce and Chief Multi-Webmaster. These terms fell by the wayside and became incorporated into tech or marketing. No one thought of online as an option; it became a must. We&#8217;ll get there with tokens and digital assets. The term NFT has been tarnished, and even Web3 has become caught up in that. When people used Facebook, they didn&#8217;t think they were on a Web2 platform; they just had a better online experience. I think we&#8217;ll get there with Web3 as well. Having a token will allow you to move more seamlessly between platforms, making the experience of being in a community or having a loyalty scheme smoother. We&#8217;re at the early stages of building that infrastructure. From an authentication standpoint, it makes sense. Token gating was complicated, but now a token allows you to do things more fluidly. Digital assets are here to stay. The language is still up in the air, whether we&#8217;ll use the term NFT in five years or just digital art or digital assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re still big believers. It&#8217;s been a rough ride, and floor prices have dropped, but there&#8217;s a more mature understanding of the market now. Some NFTs are surpassing their auction highs from the height of the market, particularly those artists who have crossed over into the fine art community. Generative art is here to stay, and tokens among merchants are becoming more common. We&#8217;d love your merchants to try our app on the WooCommerce store and get in touch with us directly. We do custom development for merchants but also put as much in our core product as possible. Right now, on WooCommerce, we support minting and certification. We&#8217;ll be adding additional functionality as the app evolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Perfect. Thank you for letting people know where they can get ahold of you. Last question: as someone with insight into the brave new world of luxury consumerism, what&#8217;s the most unexpected luxury thing you&#8217;ve had a certificate of authentication for through Verisart?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We have two things that were surprising. One is a very high-end watchmaker based in the Middle East. These watches are real works of art, costing more than most works of art, starting at $50,000. That was unusual for me to see such a high</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-end product being certified on Verisart. The other is amazing calligraphy designs, carved in wood and highly intricate, also from that part of the world. We also have a Maori arts collective doing art from New Zealand. That&#8217;s the great thing about my job—we&#8217;re always seeing new ways creators and merchants find to certify their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />It must be wonderful to live at that intersection between technology and art. It&#8217;s been wonderful talking to you, Robert. I&#8217;m very grateful for your time and insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Likewise.

wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Katie:<br />Hello and welcome to Biz Chat at Do the Woo. I&#8217;m Katie Keith from Barn2 Plugins, and today we&#8217;re going to be talking about onboarding, whether you are a freelancer wanting to improve the onboarding for new clients or whether you are an e-commerce store owner, needing to onboard customers who buy your products. To help us with this, we&#8217;ve got special guest Laura Elizabeth. Welcome, Laura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Hi. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />So can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, sure. So as of right now, I have a WordPress plugin called Client Portal, but my background is actually in web design. I worked at an agency for a year or so and then I branched out and did freelancing for about 10 years. Client Portal was made out of the work I was doing with my freelancing clients. So it was sort of like a mix between a project management tool and really having nothing at all. I started that back in 2016. I still take on the occasional freelancing project, but it&#8217;s pretty rare these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />And tell us about onboarding. Why do you think it&#8217;s so important and what got you into that as an area particularly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;ve always loved what onboarding can do for you. I was quite insecure back when I was a freelancer and I felt that having a really good onboarding process really set the stage for how the project was going to go. You can make it really repeatable and reuse it with all your clients. It just helped me because I didn&#8217;t want to go into the full agency route. I wanted to stay just as a solo freelancer. It helped me juggle multiple clients. If I had a really solid onboarding process in place, it helped my clients trust me a little bit more. When you start a project with somebody, really the beginning sets the tone for how everything&#8217;s going to go. So if I had a really solid onboarding process, it just started the project off, and by having a system in place, things started going a lot more smoothly. My clients were happier, I was happier. It just worked out a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That makes a lot of sense because when people hire a freelancer or even an agency for their website, they&#8217;ve made the decision based on lots of things like your portfolio, the quality of your website, possibly a recommendation. But ultimately, it&#8217;s not like hiring a doctor where there&#8217;s a specific qualification. You have to prove your credibility in the early stages of the project. And I suppose if you&#8217;re kind of all over the place at the beginning and you&#8217;re not providing clear onboarding, then that might make them doubt the decision they&#8217;ve made to hire you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I even find that now. So now I&#8217;m more on the other side of things where I&#8217;m the client and I hire freelancers. It really does make such a difference if I hire someone and I can see they&#8217;ve got some kind of process in place. It doesn&#8217;t need to be elaborate, but if they have things they can give me where they tell me how they work, answer maybe commonly asked questions, or things like that, it just feels like they&#8217;ve done this before. Nobody wants to feel like a guinea pig or a test subject when you&#8217;re doing a client project. If I&#8217;m hiring someone, I want to feel like they do this all the time, they know how to handle the entire project no matter what it is. It could be a website project, it could be consulting, marketing, whatever. I just feel like onboarding throughout the course of the project really helps gain that trust and it just sets the whole project off from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Since we are talking about the freelancer and agency side of onboarding, let&#8217;s focus on that a bit more first, and then later on we can talk about onboarding for e-commerce store owners. So can you walk me through an optimal onboarding experience for a new client project? What should that include?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, so it kind of starts slightly before the onboarding when you are qualifying the client. I like to put quite a lot of effort into qualifying my clients because I&#8217;m sure everyone&#8217;s experienced this: you get on calls with a potential client, you give them a ton of advice, things are going really well, and then you send your proposal and they say, &#8220;Oh wait, I have a budget of $500.&#8221; And it&#8217;s just completely wasted. I feel like everyone has to learn that the hard way. So it starts with qualifying the client, and you can do that with things like intake questionnaires, the discovery call, the proposal. I actually did a lot of paid discovery sessions with my clients. I was doing it before a website redesign project. So, paid discovery is where you do essentially the whole proposal stage as a productized service. So your clients will pay you to do a proposal, which might sound a little crazy because you can imagine what client would want to pay for a proposal. But it&#8217;s kind of a consulting thing. You work with them to figure out everything they need in their business, you deliver them a report where they can take it, implement it themselves, get someone else to do it, or ideally get you to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found that had a ton of benefits overall, both for me and my clients, but specifically with the onboarding, it really helped because almost every client went through that same process. So it was really easy for me to create reusable assets that I would use with them. I would have a VA who would help me send the right things at the right time. It would be things like a contract, like an NDA or something like that, and then we would send different questionnaires for their business, gathering all the data, send them a getting started guide, what to expect, the payment, everything was a lot more automated. So I always think with onboarding, if you can have some kind of fixed scope project that you do at the start, it makes your job a lot easier. But even if you can&#8217;t do that, what I tend to recommend is there&#8217;s no one size fits all with onboarding. It&#8217;s really a case of laying out your process and figuring out what your client needs, what problems your clients tend to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people have issues with clients maybe micromanaging projects or scope creep or things like that that crop up during the project. Are there ways in your onboarding to help solve those? So could you say something like, it&#8217;s quite likely with big custom projects that the scope is going to change? That&#8217;s absolutely fine and we expect that. Here&#8217;s how that will work. And that&#8217;s just an example of something you could include in your onboarding to help you later down the road. I know for me, scope creep was a particularly difficult one, but I also liked to set them up in a system where they could access everything at one time, and this is kind of where Client Portal came about. I tried onboarding them into different project management tools and I would find that they were really useful for me, particularly if I was working with contractors on their project or if you&#8217;re an agency, project management tools are pretty great. But then when I&#8217;d add my client to it, they didn&#8217;t want to learn a new system, they didn&#8217;t use it, they didn&#8217;t log in. And actually, like I was saying earlier, now I&#8217;m more on the client side. I also hate being added to a project management tool because I don&#8217;t want to change anything or post anything in it because I don&#8217;t want to mess up their already perfect-looking system and I just can&#8217;t be bothered. So you end up resorting back to email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I totally agree. I hate it when I hire someone like, I don&#8217;t know, an SEO agency or something like that and they put me on their project management system. There are so many, it&#8217;s probably one I&#8217;ve never used before. I don&#8217;t care what their internal systems are as the client. Things like notifications become a nightmare. You don&#8217;t know how it works. You&#8217;ll ask for an update and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, it was on this card here.&#8221; Well, I didn&#8217;t know that. And also, alternatively, you get a notification for everything. And I feel that generally adding clients to your internal project management tool is not in the client&#8217;s interest. So yeah, it&#8217;s good to have an alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />And you also get that if your team is quite big, your client won&#8217;t really know who they&#8217;re supposed to be talking to. They won&#8217;t know, &#8220;Am I supposed to be replying to this? Are they not?&#8221; It just gets really overwhelming for them. And I&#8217;m similar to you, I hate being added to different project management tools, it&#8217;s just hard. I felt like project management tools weren&#8217;t really working for me. They were working for me internally. I didn&#8217;t want clients to see the kind of things I was talking about with contractors. And I&#8217;ve heard loads of horror stories as well of people who have accidentally posted something that the client can see that they maybe shouldn&#8217;t have posted. Maybe it&#8217;s about the client, I don&#8217;t really know, but there&#8217;s always the risk that&#8217;s going to happen. You&#8217;ll post something that they shouldn&#8217;t see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought, well, I&#8217;m not going to bother adding clients to my project management tool. But then when you take that away, if you have all these onboarding documents that you&#8217;ve created, so these getting started guides, these questionnaires, the contract invoices, whatever it might be, if you take the project management tool away, you don&#8217;t really have anything. So you tend to send these files through email. You have these really long email threads, but that really didn&#8217;t feel polished and professional enough either. And I also had the problem where clients would come back to me and say, &#8220;Where&#8217;s this file? I can&#8217;t find it. I didn&#8217;t save it, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And that would be really complicated. So I created a portal where they could sign up on my website, log in, and just have everything there available to them. And it was totally separate from the project management tool. So it would only have the very few things</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that a client actually needs to see and would need to access on a regular basis. And that really helped because it was sort of the middle ground between nothing and a project management tool. And I just created that in WordPress with private pages and all that kind of thing. I did eventually turn it into a product. It can be just something, a private area on your website that they can log into. And I found that was super useful for my clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Is that more work for the freelancer or agency because they have to populate that with, do they do things like project updates in it or simply the onboarding information?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />You can do either really. I personally prefer to keep it very simple and repeatable. So I would set up a template and it would have all their onboarding documents that were the same for every single client doing that particular project. So it would be an onboarding template or a project template for a paid discovery, for example. And then I would have a separate one if I was doing a website redesign or I would have a separate one, maybe, I don&#8217;t know, copywriting or whatever services you offer, and you just put in the stuff that is common to pretty much every client as a template. So you don&#8217;t have to recreate all that. And then however you store your deliverables, you would just link to what you&#8217;re already using. So I wouldn&#8217;t spend a lot of time uploading things to the portal. The way I thought of it at the time was like a bookmarks bar that was in a branded portal on your website that your clients could log into. So at the time I was doing websites and I would use Envision for my prototype, so I would just link to Envision. So it didn&#8217;t really take an awful lot of time, but it is something that if you do have a VA, which I pretty much recommend almost all freelancers have one if they can because it just makes life a lot easier. It&#8217;s something that they can just go in and add the odd link to it. But I always recommend keeping it as simple as possible, actually having as little in there as possible, but making sure that what&#8217;s in there are the things that your client needs to access time and time again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That makes sense. So you&#8217;ve referred to VAs a couple of times. It&#8217;s slightly off topic, but virtual assistants can be really useful. Do you have any tips on where to find one? Because a lot of freelancers can&#8217;t afford to hire somebody freelance, and so what are the different ways you can find somebody to help with those tasks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I&#8217;ve hired VAs from a few different places. The best one I had was from a website called Hawkey Handbook. I don&#8217;t actually know if it&#8217;s still around. I haven&#8217;t checked, but I think that&#8217;s what it was called. Gina taught people how to become virtual assistants and then she had a pool of people where you could post a job, and I had a virtual assistant there for years and she was really great. I&#8217;ve also tried hiring just from people I know because they&#8217;re kind of tasks that really anyone can do as long as you&#8217;ve got good processes in place. But yeah, my favorite one was the Hawkey Handbook place where I hired a VA. It can take a little bit of trial and error and hiring a VA is actually a lot of work upfront because if you don&#8217;t have systems and processes and things documented, it takes a long time to get that in place and it can take a long time to train a VA. But once you&#8217;ve found that rhythm and they work with you, they&#8217;re really invaluable, especially when working with clients. Because if you are like me, I was mostly solo but would just work with contractors. It was really hard doing the actual work, which is the bit I loved, and then dealing with new lead inquiries, keeping up to date with current clients, or even following up with leads that didn&#8217;t work out, or doing outreach, all that kind of stuff that you need to do constantly. It just takes that off your plate to have somebody as a middleman managing. For me, it was mostly email and client communication. So yeah, I think VAs are really, really important, but a big investment both time and money upfront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Definitely. I used to use a company called Remote Staff for a VA for years because as a plugin company, I have a support team and one of my support engineers spends half her time doing VA tasks, which might be finance or marketing or general admin or whatever. So I found that good. They were already trained in our products from doing support. They do VA tasks as well and it gives them more insights into different parts of the business and things. So there&#8217;s lots of ways you can get them without doing a traditional job advert to hire someone if that&#8217;s not in budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />And you don&#8217;t even need to hire full-time as well. I only ever had one full-time VA, and I found it was actually a bit much. At the minute, I&#8217;m similar to you. I have a support person who does some VA tasks and I think they only do a couple of hours a day and really that&#8217;s enough to just get through your inbox and do whatever recurring tasks need to be done. I think two hours a day minimum will get you through most client communication things that you might need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I find it really helpful to write a list of what I actually do before hiring somebody, because sometimes when you group your tasks, it&#8217;s not what you think. So when I do it, actually I need a finance assistant and a marketing assistant and very little general admin. So I might go for a general VA when that&#8217;s not the skillset I need. So it is useful to actually write down what you do. You may not have an understanding of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point actually. Time track maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, exactly. All of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />So let&#8217;s get back to onboarding. We went on a useful tangent then. We&#8217;ve talked about onboarding for clients who you are providing services for. So let&#8217;s move on and talk a bit about onboarding for e-commerce stores. And it&#8217;s something you may not really think of because let&#8217;s say if someone buys a pair of shoes or something on a website, they probably don&#8217;t need any onboarding, but there are e-commerce products that do need some kind of support and communication from that company after making a purchase. An example might be a membership site where they&#8217;re joining some kind of a club with an ongoing relationship. It might be that they&#8217;ve booked an event and they need information in the run-up to that event and the date of it or any kind of product that needs some kind of special advice or instructions for the customer to use it, which aren&#8217;t shipped with the product, which happens in various industries. So do you have any advice about the email side of things? I know you and I have previously talked on a different podcast about your expertise in email marketing. Do you have any advice about how email might play a part in onboarding for e-commerce store owners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Funnily enough, I recently bought some shoes and their onboarding was pretty good. They were running trainers or sneakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />You needed onboarding for shoes, fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s funny because you say they didn&#8217;t need onboarding for shoes, but these were specifically running shoes, so it kind of makes sense if they were just regular shoes, probably not. But it was quite nice because they sent a follow-up sequence of just different things about how to care for running shoes, how often to replace them, and tips on running as well because presumably if you&#8217;re buying running shoes, you&#8217;re probably a runner. And so I thought that was quite helpful. But I think with onboarding for emails, it&#8217;s actually a really difficult thing to get right, because as you know, inboxes are just full right now and everything you buy, there&#8217;s a lot of emails that come after you always get added to the newsletter. It&#8217;s quite overwhelming. So the first thing I would say about that is to make sure you&#8217;re not sending a newsletter at the same time you&#8217;re sending onboarding. But with onboarding emails, I think one thing I really like that I&#8217;ve seen, this is more for SaaS software, are people who send the odd email. I think it&#8217;s maybe once a week I would say getting the timing right is important and it&#8217;s very, very short and it&#8217;s one very small tip that I could read in a few seconds about using whatever software that I&#8217;ve just signed up for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s really great. That&#8217;s actually something I want to put into my own onboarding because I have, for Client Portal, I have a getting started guide and a few little things like that. I have a new customer survey because it&#8217;s always good to try if you can, to learn about people who have just bought. So it&#8217;s finding that balance between things that you would find useful as the business owner, plus what your customers would find useful. But yeah, I really like these new SaaS companies who are just sending these little tips specifically in software that are probably really obvious to the founder or people who use it regularly. It could be like a keyboard shortcut or just some really basic feature that just makes your life a lot easier. I think that&#8217;s really nice because I don&#8217;t think people are reading emails, they&#8217;re getting so many and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re reading them. They&#8217;re as focused when they&#8217;re reading them as they maybe were a few years ago, at least in my experience. So yeah, that&#8217;s something I would try, but I haven&#8217;t tested it, so I don&#8217;t actually know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I really like that. Keeping it short, as you say, people do get email overwhelmed, but it is an opportunity still. With our plugins, we&#8217;ve created a unique sequence in MailChimp for each of our plugins, similar to what you said, but probably not as brief. So I will look at that. For example, if someone buys our WooCommerce product options plugin, then we&#8217;ll send an automated email straight away with instructions on how to set it up. After three days, we send a check</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-in email, how are you getting on? Here&#8217;s a video, here&#8217;s some extra links to resources in case you&#8217;re stuck, how to contact us, those kinds of things. With running shoes, if you&#8217;re happy with them pretty quickly, you&#8217;re going to keep using them and when they wear out, hopefully buy from the same company. But with WordPress, we have an annual subscription, so we need the customer to renew after one year and two years, which means that to encourage renewals, we want to have an ongoing relationship with the customer, which is largely automated of course. So our emails after the first couple of weeks slow down and there might be one every two or three months, and then they might speed up a bit shortly before each renewal. And like you mentioned, we provide tips. So for WooCommerce product options, an email after four months might talk about lesser-used features. You know, you could set a maximum quantity of how many pizza toppings the customer can buy or something like that, or did you know about this extra way of pricing your product options and things that they might not know to help them get more value out of it? And then we might sneak in a marketing email every now and then recommending a related product, but that shouldn&#8217;t be the main thing of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, I do something similar. I actually have found it quite hard to time emails up to renewal time because people could maybe upgrade their license or do different things throughout that process, and I found it quite hard from a technical perspective to set that up. So I tend to have an onboarding sequence that&#8217;s the same for everybody. It&#8217;s fortunate for me because I only have one plugin as opposed to multiple, and it&#8217;s all serving a similar audience. After the onboarding sequence, it just goes into my general monthly, or it&#8217;s not always monthly, newsletter where I&#8217;ll share a new example or a new case study or something like that. But I really want to have something in place that&#8217;s more akin to when it&#8217;s getting close to their renewal date. I just haven&#8217;t found a way to actually implement that yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do also do a little bit of upselling as well because I created a sister company from Client Portal. One thing I found was people loved the portal, but they were having trouble putting together these getting started guides and these intake questionnaires, they didn&#8217;t know what to put in them. Whereas I did create portal templates, the portal templates didn&#8217;t include content. So I created a sister company that has these templates that have all the exact wording that I would use with my clients. They&#8217;re nicely designed but easily editable, that kind of thing. So after, I think it&#8217;s about six weeks or so, I do a little mini promotion for that and then give customers a discount if they want to buy that. But it is kind of a separate company, it&#8217;s still mine. So I think there&#8217;s room to upsell people. I think it&#8217;s just important to upsell them for something that they genuinely would be interested in rather than just whatever you have. Have you identified another problem that these customers tend to have that you could solve with a different product and upsell them on that? I think that&#8217;s quite a good way, and I&#8217;ve never had any backlash about doing that because, like I say, it&#8217;s something people genuinely want, so they&#8217;re quite happy to receive those emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Absolutely. I&#8217;ve got, I think, 19 premium plugins now, and we only upsell closely related ones. So say someone&#8217;s bought a WooCommerce restaurant plugin, a lot of them sell things like pizzas or burgers that need extra toppings, which you can do with our product options plugin. So we&#8217;ll email the restaurant customers not saying, have you heard about WooCommerce product options? It&#8217;s great. We will say, do you want to sell extra toppings and charge for them for your pizzas and burgers and so on, and be really, really specific. And those emails get quite a good conversion rate. In fact, we have an email that we send about a week after purchase, which recommend handpicked products based on what they bought, and that does quite well at getting that second purchase in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s talk a bit about tools. So I&#8217;ve mentioned that we use MailChimp to send that, but there are other things as well. Obviously, there are many competitors to MailChimp, and whichever email marketing platform you use, you can integrate with your WooCommerce website. There&#8217;s also a WooCommerce plugin that I really like. It used to be called follow-ups, and then it got merged into a plugin called Automate Woo. It&#8217;s on WooCommerce.com, and you can use that to send different emails to your customers based on what products they bought. So if you have running shoes, for example, then instead of doing it through your email platform, you could do it through your WooCommerce store and have a different product as the trigger for each email. So that&#8217;s quite good. We actually do ours through Recapture because we sell through Easy Digital Downloads rather than WooCommerce and hardly anything integrates with that, which is really frustrating. So we use Recapture for our abandoned cart software and also for our follow-up emails that recommend related products and things. So there&#8217;s lots of tools. What do you use, Laura?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />My tooling has changed a little bit. I use ConvertKit for my emails, and then I did use Easy Digital Downloads, but I&#8217;ve actually just migrated completely over to Freemius, and that&#8217;s really nice because it has all the abandoned cart features built in. It&#8217;s actually got a lot of the email built in as well. So I&#8217;m putting a pause on my ConvertKit onboarding to just test out what they have out of the box because they say they do a lot of testing with the emails and try to time them quite well and do all that kind of stuff. So I&#8217;m just having a look at that at the minute. Talking about personalization. One tool I really like, and I have to say I&#8217;m a bit biased, this is my husband&#8217;s company, but he runs a company called Right Message, and that&#8217;s really nice because what it allows you to do is if you have, say, so I would have for Client Portal, maybe I&#8217;d have agencies or freelancers, we have law firms, accountants, all those different industries,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can learn about different subscribers in ConvertKit and then change content on my website based on what I know about them. So for example, if I had a landing page and I was talking to an accountant via email, if they clicked through to my website, I could change the wording to speak more to accountants. And that&#8217;s been really fun to play around with just to make the whole experience more personal. One really easy example actually is if someone&#8217;s already on your email list and they go to your website, instead of seeing a popup to join your email list, which is annoying for a customer, but also annoying for you because you can end up with duplicate subscribers, they&#8217;ll see something else, so they might see nothing at all, or you could change it to be a popup for them to leave a review or join your affiliate program or something like that. So you can change what they&#8217;re seeing on your website based on what you know about them and where they are in your funnel, which is pretty nice. But other than that, I keep my tooling pretty simple. It&#8217;s mostly just Freemius, ConvertKit, Right Message, and that&#8217;s about it, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, makes sense. About two months ago, I think we had Paul Halfpenny from the PersonalizeWP plugin on this show, and we talked about different personalization strategies and there&#8217;s a lot you can do, but we talked mostly about pre-sales, but that is a good point about onboarding as well, so that when customers log in, you can show them different information based on various factors. So there&#8217;s a lot you can do with that, which is quite a kind of modern approach that WordPress is just kind of starting to discover fairly recently, I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of crazy what you can do now. It&#8217;s a bit scary sometimes, but it&#8217;s fun to play around with. I think the thing that you can get caught up on is sometimes you can go a little bit deep on it and do a little bit too much, and the more complexity you add, I&#8217;ve learned this the hard way, eventually something&#8217;s probably going to break or go wrong and it can be really hard to untangle it. So I really try my hardest to keep things as simple as possible, but stuff like that is just really fun to play around with and it does really work as well. So yeah, it&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;d suggest focusing on the biggest wins there. So not every possible customer&#8217;s use case needs to have personalized content. Maybe pick out your biggest use cases that you get the most sales from and create targeted content for those that&#8217;s going to have the most impact without being ridiculously complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, exactly. And just testing it as well, just making sure it works. It should work. Anything that&#8217;s more personalized should work. But yeah, it&#8217;s always good to test as much as you can,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Which is kind of hard because you have to replicate the environment it&#8217;s targeted for, don&#8217;t you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard. I find testing it is a lot easier. The higher volume of everything you have, the easier testing becomes just because you get to see trends. If you don&#8217;t have a ton of traffic or you don&#8217;t have a ton of customers, it can be really hard to know why certain things happen. Is it a seasonal lull, for example? It&#8217;s like July right now, so it&#8217;s historically not a great month for, well, really a lot of people, everyone&#8217;s on holiday. It&#8217;s just so hard to know unless you&#8217;ve got a really big company to easily see those trends. But it&#8217;s still good to try and keep an eye on it if you can, but just not get too focused on the details, not looking every day, looking at trends maybe across months or even years sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Absolutely. It&#8217;s easy to panic if you have a drop in sales over the short term and you need to wait until it&#8217;s statistically significant, if I can say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />It&#8217;s hard because unless you track this data every year, so I&#8217;ve recently started keeping a spreadsheet of, and I&#8217;ve only done it for the last three years, but it is really useful. January is a particularly good month for me. Obviously, November is good, the summer is less good, and it&#8217;s interesting to see, and I know that every year I&#8217;ve probably had the same level of panic during the lower months that if I&#8217;d have just kept an eye on these trends, I might not have needed to panic so much. It just kind of happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Definitely. Last month we had Bryce Adams from Metorik on talking about reporting and how to get better data out of your online store because people often are having to create spreadsheets and things like that, whereas you should just have it at the click of a button. It&#8217;s kind of crazy how bad the reporting and things like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads is straight out of the box, so you do need extra plugins and SaaS and so on to give you what you need or build it yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, exactly. I find it hard with Easy Digital Downloads. I felt like they changed things quite a lot and I was never sure if the numbers were the same, but I do actually find no matter how good the reporting is, I do find something really useful about putting it into a spreadsheet each month because it forces me to really look at it and see where it&#8217;s changed. That might just be a me thing though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Everyone works with data in different ways and so on. We ended up building our own custom system for Easy Digital Downloads to give us the data we needed because it was just so difficult. And then we found out this week that they changed something a few months ago that had broken all of our data, so we thought we had a massive drop in sales and a massive increase in renewals, but they had just changed internally how they classified sales and renewals. So it was a definition change, and we spent ages trying to work out why this would have happened. So again, never easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s a nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Another aspect of onboarding, which I think people often forget about is the sequence that happens when the customer places an order and immediately afterwards. Since this is Do the Woo, I&#8217;ll use WooCommerce as an example. With WooCommerce, you have built-in emails and order statuses, and then when you change the order status, it triggers an email. I often find the default ones really unhelpful. I know Woo is actually working on this at the moment and thinking about how to improve the order statuses and the corresponding emails, but I ordered, I think it was a Woo T-shirt actually customized with the logo. So I received the email saying, thank you for your order. Fine. It said when it would ship. Fine. Then I received it, and then about a week later I received an order completed email from them. I&#8217;m like, hang on, I&#8217;ve already got it. I don&#8217;t care that you&#8217;ve marked it as complete on your system. And it wasn&#8217;t about me as the customer. I think that all store owners should think about things like these statuses. Another one is when you order a digital product in WooCommerce, it will set it to processing and send an email, and then you have to manually set it to completed, which sends another email. But of course, a digital product has been served automatically at the time they place the order, and so they don&#8217;t need another email. So you have to use a plugin order status manager to disable the completed email and all that stuff. So I&#8217;d say test it and think about your customer. Would you add anything to that, Laura?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Just that it&#8217;s always a good idea to periodically go through and buy your own product, just do a test purchase or something and just see what happens because things do change a lot. Even like you said, with the Easy Digital Downloads changing something, you never know what&#8217;s going to change. I recently did that and I found that all my images in the emails were coming out really massive. I guess ConvertKit had changed something or something had happened, but you just don&#8217;t know until you&#8217;ve gone through it as the customer. And that&#8217;s where you can really easily find those things where you&#8217;re getting these emails where orders are being set from process to complete and then they&#8217;re getting a notification you can go in and just hopefully turn that off. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably the best way to do it. I would say, maybe every six months, just go in and do a test purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />You&#8217;ll probably be surprised at how many emails your poor customers are receiving because they get one from PayPal if they use PayPal and all the ones from your website. And you might have a per-product email with instructions for that particular product all at the same time. So you need to think how annoying is that for people as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, exactly. You get five emails at once that hopefully you can condense into just one email, which would be perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />You mentioned earlier about the subsequent emails and making sure, say, your newsletter doesn&#8217;t go out at the same time as onboarding emails. I think that&#8217;s good advice on an ongoing basis too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, exactly. There&#8217;s a lot you can optimize, and it can, like I say, get messy. Even simple systems can get messy really quickly depending on different customers if they use a different email address. I know you can&#8217;t account for every edge case, but I went down the rabbit hole years ago of doing some really cool things with email marketing, but I&#8217;ve drastically cut it back now just to make sure that everyone&#8217;s getting a similar experience and that I have a bit more control over what they&#8217;re seeing. So I&#8217;m not sending any emails out by mistake or anything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />It can be a lot of work to keep all your emails up to date. We&#8217;ve got hundreds of automated emails because we have a sequence for each product, and I know they&#8217;re not as up to date as they should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I think a lot of people document, they have a master document of all of their sequences, and I started putting that together for mine as well, just to keep somewhere completely separate, just in a Google Doc or something, to just write down the process. This is similar to the client onboarding as well. It&#8217;s how I got started with it. Just bullet point every single touch point with either the client or the customer in as minute detail as possible, as many different edge cases as possible, and then just try to figure out what the ideal most smooth process would look like, whether that&#8217;s creating email sequences, whether it&#8217;s creating templates or even just templated emails using text expand or something like that just for these commonly repeatable tasks that happen within your process. I think it&#8217;s really useful. Just spending, it can take an hour, maybe if that, and it&#8217;s super, super valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I have a Google Doc with a list of all our emails and when they&#8217;re sent so that we can see it in one place, but that doesn&#8217;t have the content of the emails, so it&#8217;s still a big job to update them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />And you have to remember to update when I make an update somewhere, update it elsewhere as well, which can be hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Before we finish, let&#8217;s talk about measuring the success of your onboarding. Do you have any advice on how to track the effectiveness of your onboarding efforts and what you might look at to judge what you&#8217;re doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />On the WordPress plugin side, I mostly look at refund rates. I think if I do a good job of onboarding, my refund rates go down. I have actually found recently my refund rates have decreased by quite a lot. In part, it&#8217;s due to the fact that we did completely overhaul the product, and it now uses the block editor and it&#8217;s really, really nice. But another thing that I did was I put an awful lot of effort into the getting started video, and I used feedback that we&#8217;ve had from customers, common questions where customers have got stuck, things that seem really obvious to me as the creator of the product that weren&#8217;t clearly obvious to the customers. I&#8217;ve then included it in the video, and I spent a long time making this video as good as it can be and just improving that onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, I don&#8217;t know, unfortunately, whether the refund rate has reduced because of the new product or the onboarding or a combination of both. But I have noticed anecdotally that we are getting far fewer support requests from people who are just struggling to get started with the product. So I don&#8217;t handle support myself, but I do keep an eye on it. Most days. I try and just see what people are asking, and I get my support person to do a weekly report with any issues, common themes of issues people had, and virtually none since we released it. I think in, I want to say April are how do I get started? And we actually did used to get that quite commonly before then. So that&#8217;s kind of how I measure it. Like I said, it&#8217;s quite a small company, it&#8217;s not a massive company, so I can&#8217;t do a ton with analytics and stuff. But yeah, I just keep an eye on refund rates and then just my general support in that respect. And then for client onboarding, it&#8217;s similar to that, but even more extreme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could have hundreds of customers, but maybe a dozen clients or something. So it&#8217;s harder to manage and to really know, but generally you&#8217;re talking to clients, so you&#8217;re getting a feel for, are there any assumptions that they had that were perhaps wrong? If so, maybe you could fix that in your onboarding. Do they say, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really enjoying working with you. This is really great.&#8221; That&#8217;s something that can give you an indication as to whether it&#8217;s done correctly. One other thing I do with clients actually is I tend to send out a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>questionnaire when the project&#8217;s only just started, and it&#8217;s similar to the questionnaire that you&#8217;d send at the end to get their feedback, but I do it more towards the beginning and find out how it&#8217;s going so far. Generally, clients are pretty excited, and that gives me a really good indication of how did they find the onboarding experience? Was it good? Was it great? Was there any improvements? That kind of thing&#8217;s helpful. So yeah, I just track it really, I guess anecdotally is the best way to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think that works for clients in particular. If they&#8217;re asking questions that you should have told them, if they&#8217;re asking really basic questions about the process, expectations, anything like that, then that&#8217;s a problem with your onboarding, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, exactly. And there&#8217;s always ways you can fix that, especially if it&#8217;s common things. I think I mentioned earlier scope creep for me was always the biggest one. It always happened, and I hadn&#8217;t set that expectation. I put together a proposal and it was fairly detailed, but something had changed. It may not have been the client&#8217;s fault, it may not have been my fault, but something has changed. Well, who&#8217;s responsible for taking on that extra cost? Is it me? Is it the client? And if you have these conversations in the early stages, it just makes things a lot easier further down the road when you&#8217;re inevitably going to hit these roadblocks that everyone experiences when working with clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, scope creeps a good one because everybody deals with it. I find the best way to handle it is one, to make it clear what was included, as you say, through clear documentation and proposal and all of that. And then when the customer does ask for something that wasn&#8217;t in the scope, I think it&#8217;s nice to be kind of positive. Well, that&#8217;s a great idea. I think that&#8217;s a really big improvement to what we have planned. Let me cost it out for you. You haven&#8217;t said no, that&#8217;s not included, have you as a positive? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly what I would do as well is I would say I would always start with yes. So I talk in a lot of Facebook groups with freelancers and agencies, and it&#8217;s really interesting to see it as a third party where a client, there&#8217;s a bit of scope route going on, a client needs something else, and the freelancer is already assuming that the client is going to be really annoyed if you charge them any more for it. But the client has not indicated that they&#8217;re annoyed. I&#8217;ve worked with people and the scope increased, and I have, in my head, I&#8217;m thinking, of course the price is going to go up. I shouldn&#8217;t need to say that&#8217;s obviously going to happen, but the freelancer could then go into this spiral of this is going to be a massive conflict. And they start with, I did say in the proposal it was going to include this, this and this. This wasn&#8217;t included. I&#8217;m not going to do it. Whereas if you just say, oh, great idea, yeah, it&#8217;ll be an extra blah or Let me cost it out, or whatever you say, but I think that&#8217;s a great thing to do. I think I&#8217;ve never had pushback when I just said it like that, or if I have, it would be not a conflict, but more just like, actually, let&#8217;s just wait on that and maybe do that later, or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, the time you get pushback is when you don&#8217;t tell them straight away. So if you send them a higher bill than expected at the end of the project, that can be a disaster. And I&#8217;ve made that mistake and lost a lot of money and had very unhappy customers in the past through when we were doing web design work. So you need to be clear before there are extra costs, but matter of fact about it, they probably assumed you would charge extra anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s actually very similar to how I deal with my three-year-old. I&#8217;ve noticed that if she wants something, and if I say no, if it&#8217;s a, if I say no, the second she asks for it, there tends to be not really much of a meltdown. Whereas if I dance around the subject and I sort of maybe give excuses or reasons and then eventually say no further down the line, that&#8217;s when full on meltdown happens that I think it&#8217;s kind of similar when just dealing with anyone, if it&#8217;s don&#8217;t string people along, get their hopes up or whatever. And then even if you&#8217;re in the right, dump something on them at the last minute, just be really upfront, professional, positive, calm, and just not defensive. And then things just generally, in my experience anyway, seem to just work out a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for this, Laura. It&#8217;s been great, and I think we&#8217;ve covered a lot of really concrete advice that people can hopefully go away and implement in their own businesses. So where can people find you online?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I am mostly around on Twitter, so it&#8217;s @LauraLizDunn. If you want to check out Client Portal, the website&#8217;s clientportal.io. That&#8217;s pretty much where I&#8217;m at. Not on LinkedIn yet, but I am probably about to sign up. Apparently that&#8217;s the place to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Everyone&#8217;s talking about it, but I just can&#8217;t bear the idea of another social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I know.

Well, that’s absolutely possible with decentralized identity management – an innovative system that allows individuals to own, control, and manage their identity data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how does it work?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identity management uses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to distribute identity data across a network. By doing so, it enhances security and ensures that no single entity has complete control over sensitive information. Users can selectively share specific identity attributes using cryptographic keys and digital wallets, giving them granular control over what personal information is disclosed and to whom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the key benefits, real-world applications, and technological advancements driving this revolutionary approach. And if you&#8217;re wondering how to implement decentralized profile management on your website, we&#8217;ve got you covered with a closer look at <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Importance of decentralized identity management for businesses</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses face many challenges when managing customer identities. From data breaches to identity theft, the risks are real and can have devastating consequences. Decentralized identity management offers a secure and efficient means of user control, though this involves effective implementation through navigating technical complexities, regulatory uncertainties, and user adoption hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at the full benefits of decentralized identity management!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhanced security and fraud prevention: </strong>By distributing personal identifiers across a network, decentralized systems make it incredibly difficult for hackers to access and steal sensitive information. Even if one node in the network is compromised, the data remains safe, as it&#8217;s not stored in a central location. This added layer of security helps businesses protect their customers&#8217; data and reduces the risk of costly data breaches.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Regulatory compliance: </strong>With strict data protection laws like the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"nofollow\">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> in place, companies must be transparent about how they handle customer data. Decentralized systems make this easier by giving users control over their personal information, such as deciding what data to share and with whom.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operational efficiency:</strong> In traditional systems, businesses often waste time and resources on repetitive verification processes. With decentralized identity, they are replaced with fixed audit trails and verifiable credentials, which are much more efficient. Companies can quickly and easily verify customer identities without the need for redundant checks, saving time and money in the long run.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Building trust and loyalty with customers: </strong>By giving people control over their personal data, companies show that they value privacy and are committed to protecting sensitive information. This level of transparency and respect can go a long way in fostering long-lasting relationships with users, ultimately leading to increased retention and loyalty. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Importance of decentralized identity management for users and customers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identity management is becoming more important as users seek greater control over their personal information. However, there’s much more to it than that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Standardized protocols allow identity data to be used across various services. Users don&#8217;t need multiple accounts or to go through repeated verification checks, which reduces hassle and makes the online experience smoother.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security against identity theft: </strong>Decentralized identity systems provide strong security features. These systems protect users from identity theft and fraud. By reducing reliance on centralized databases, the risk of data breaches decreases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced user experience: </strong>Users can enjoy a more streamlined experience. No need to remember multiple usernames and passwords. Logging into different services becomes quicker and more convenient.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control over personal data: </strong>Users have the power to manage their own identity information. They can decide how much data to share and with whom. This approach reduces the risk of personal data misuse and enhances privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One example is signing up for a new service online. Traditionally, this involves creating a new account, verifying email addresses, and setting up passwords. With decentralized identity management, users can leverage their existing identity credentials to sign up, saving time and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identity management is an incredible technical innovation that changes how people interact with digital services. By putting control back into the hands of users, it promises a future where personal data is more secure and user experiences are more enjoyable. And that&#8217;s something worth looking forward to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Centralized vs. decentralized identity management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the differences between centralized and decentralized identity management systems can help businesses and users make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-contrast-background-color has-background has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aspect</strong></td><td><strong>Centralized identity management</strong></td><td><strong>Decentralized identity management</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Control</strong></td><td>Controlled by one entity, meaning users rely on this entity to manage their identity data.</td><td>Users have control over their identity information, distributing authority and reducing dependency on a single organization.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security</strong></td><td>Vulnerable to data breaches because all data is stored in one place. If that central database is compromised, all stored identities are at risk.</td><td>Spreads the data across multiple points, making it harder for hackers to access all information. This reduces the chance of a large-scale data breach.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scalability</strong></td><td>Easier to scale within a company&#8217;s existing infrastructure since it relies on a singular, controlled environment.</td><td>Scaling decentralized systems involves challenges such as ensuring network size doesn&#8217;t affect performance and maintaining interoperability between different Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a large company&#8217;s central database is hacked, all user data could be compromised. In contrast, a decentralized system&#8217;s distributed nature means that even if one node is breached, the overall impact is minimized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decentralized vs. federated vs. self-sovereign identities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigating the different types of identity systems can be tricky. Let&#8217;s break down the differences between decentralized, federated, and self-sovereign identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decentralized identity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Users own and control their identity without intermediaries, and their data is not stored in a single central location, reducing the risks of breaches. This system is gaining traction as data privacy and security become more critical in the digital economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Federated identity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, multiple organizations allow the same identity credentials to access various services, so the user data is somewhat centralized, but it’s still spread across the entities involved. It’s very similar to using your social media account to log into different apps and websites – convenient but involves sharing your data with multiple entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-sovereign identity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an extension of decentralized identity, where users have minimal reliance on any secondary parties for their identity management. They decide when and with whom to share data, and no third party holds their information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Applications of decentralized identity management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Online authentication</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identity systems enable users to securely authenticate their identities when accessing various online services. Instead of relying on a central authority to manage their identity data, users can prove their identity using cryptographic keys associated with their decentralized identifiers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach enhances security by reducing the risk of data breaches. For example, logging into an online service with a DID means your identity is verified without exposing sensitive information to potential hackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Government registries</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Government registries can issue digital versions of traditional IDs, such as passports or driver&#8217;s licenses. Imagine having a digital credential that verifies your age or nationality without needing to disclose your full identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be particularly useful for online age verification or when proving residency for government services. By using decentralized identity systems, governments can streamline verification processes while improving privacy and security for their citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Educational institutions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities and colleges can act as issuers by providing digital credentials that verify educational achievements. For example, a university could issue a credential that confirms an individual&#8217;s degree. This can be used when applying for jobs or further education, making the verification process more efficient and secure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of sending physical transcripts or certificates, individuals can share their verified credentials instantly and securely with potential employers or educational institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Financial Institutions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, banks and other financial institutions can issue their own credentials that verify financial information, such as creditworthiness or account ownership. These digital credentials can streamline the process and enhance security when applying for loans or conducting high-value transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like with universities, instead of providing physical documents to prove account ownership, customers can present a digital credential issued by their bank. This reduces paperwork and speeds up transactions while maintaining high levels of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding key technologies in decentralized identity management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identity management relies on several cutting-edge technologies that focus on security, privacy, and user control. Let’s take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is evolving into Web 3.0, with a shift that brings decentralized applications and services to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User empowerment: </strong>Unlike earlier versions of the internet, where big companies controlled most data, Web 3.0 gives users control over their own digital identity. This enhances privacy and ownership as users decide what information to share and with whom.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Infrastructure support: </strong>Web 3.0 provides the necessary infrastructure for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. These tools let users manage their identities securely without needing a central authority.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, logging into different online services can be done using a single, user-controlled identity, improving security and convenience. Web 3.0 makes this possible, creating a more secure and user-friendly online experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Blockchain</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is fundamental to decentralized identity systems. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Immutable and distributed nature:</strong> Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in an immutable and secure way. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring the integrity of the entire chain.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security and trust: </strong>Blockchain&#8217;s decentralized nature means there&#8217;s no single point of failure, making it highly secure. Transactions recorded there are transparent and verifiable by all participants, fostering trust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>Blockchain platforms like <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethereum</a> support decentralized applications (dApps) that are essential for identity management. These platforms provide the infrastructure for creating and managing DIDs and verifiable credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Ethereum&#8217;s smart contract functionality lets you create complex identity management systems that operate autonomously and transparently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cryptography</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptographic techniques like hashing and public-key cryptography are essential for protecting data. Hashing converts data into a fixed-size string of characters that is unique to the original data. Public-key cryptography, on the other hand, involves a pair of keys – public and private – that enable secure communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cryptographic methods allow one party to prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself. This is crucial for secure user authentication without exposing personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when a user logs in to a service using a DID, cryptographic techniques ensure their identity is verified without revealing their underlying data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DLT is a system where data is stored across multiple locations, making it decentralized and resistant to tampering. Unlike traditional databases, which are centralized and vulnerable to hacking, DLT spreads data across a network of nodes. So, there is no single point of failure, making it extremely hard to alter records without detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology helps to maintain secure and transparent records of identity verifications and transactions. For example, in a decentralized identity system, when a user verifies their identity, the transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger. This ensures that the verification is tamper-proof and can be independently audited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLT&#8217;s transparency and security features make it ideal for managing identities, ensuring that users&#8217; data remains safe and verifiable without relying on a single, centralized authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decentralized identifiers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized identifiers are globally unique identifiers that are a key component of decentralized identity systems. Unlike traditional identifiers like email addresses or usernames, these are created, owned, and controlled by the user. They are linked to verifiable digital credentials, including information like your name, age, or professional qualifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more interesting features of DIDs is their interoperability across different networks and platforms, enabled by distributed ledger technology. This means a DID you use on one website can also be recognized and verified on another, eliminating the need to create separate accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can use it to log into a social media platform and then use the same DID to access your bank account. DIDs&#8217; interoperability ensures a hassle-free and secure experience across various services while keeping you in control of your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Verifiable credentials are vital in enhancing user privacy and control over personal data. A verifiable credential is a digital certificate that proves a claim about an individual, such as their age or educational qualification, without revealing unnecessary personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VCs have three main components: the claim, the proof, and the issuer. The claim is the actual statement about the user, such as “John has a master&#8217;s degree”. The proof is the cryptographic evidence that supports the claim, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. The issuer is the trusted entity that provides the credential, like a university or government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology is great because it <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">allows users to prove their identity</a> or qualifications selectively. For example, when applying for a job, a user can present a VC that verifies their degree without sharing their full academic record. This selective disclosure helps protect privacy while ensuring the necessary information is verified. And because these credentials are digital, they can be easily and securely shared online, making processes faster and more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar paves the way for decentralized identity in profile management&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-homepage-1-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1750\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is a profile management system that lets users create profiles linked to their email addresses instead of their names.

Before moving on to other solutions, we’ll start by showing you how to easily change your profile picture using your Gravatar profile – which as you’ll see, is the simplest method and requires no additional plugins or setup on your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you&#8217;re looking for more customization options or want to give your users the ability to upload their own profile pictures directly on your site, we&#8217;ll also cover alternative solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive in, it’s important to note that in WordPress, different user roles have different permissions related to their profile pictures (namely, whether they can upload their own or not). Let’s break these down quickly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Administrators can change their own profile picture, as well as the profile pictures of any other user.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editors can change their own profile picture.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authors and Contributors cannot change their profile picture by default. However, this capability can be granted to them by an Administrator using a plugin or custom code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subscribers cannot change their own profile picture through the WordPress dashboard. The only way for them to have a profile picture is to use Gravatar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that that’s covered, let’s discover the best ways to update profile pictures in WordPress!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to change your WordPress profile picture with Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-homepage-2-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1923\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/basic/what-is-gravatar/\">Gravatar</a>, short for &#8220;Globally Recognized Avatar,&#8221; is a service provided by <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>, the company behind <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WooCommerce</a>, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jetpack</a>, and other leading entities in the WordPress space and beyond. It’s a popular tool and free service for managing avatars across multiple sites, and it’s fully integrated into the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress pulls avatars from Gravatar, so if you have a Gravatar account, your avatar will automatically show up on your <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/09/wordpress-profile-page/\">WordPress profile</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wordpress-default-picture.png?w=660\" alt=\"Profile picture settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1922\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If not, you’ll see a generic icon like the Mystery Person, or generated icons like MonsterID, Wavatar, or Identicon, depending on your site’s settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"123\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profile-image-options-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of the generic icons \" class=\"wp-image-1921\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To use Gravatar, you need to make sure the email you use on WordPress matches the one used for Gravatar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/confirm-email-for-website.png?w=660\" alt=\"Email section in the WordPress account settings\" class=\"wp-image-1920\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have a Gravatar account, creating one is straightforward. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/basic/account-signup/\"><strong>Sign up for Gravatar</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Visit Gravatar&#8217;s website and sign up with the email address you use for your WordPress account.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> </div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Upload your image: </strong>In the sidebar menu, click on &#8220;Avatars,&#8221; and choose to upload an image from your computer, URL, or select from previously uploaded images.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> </div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>Once your Gravatar is set up, it will appear as your profile picture on all WordPress sites supporting it. Remember, changes might take some time to reflect due to caching, so don’t worry if it doesn’t update immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to enable users to change their WordPress profile pictures in the frontend&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides your own profile picture, you might also want to change the image for your users, which is what we recommend. Giving users the ability to change their profile pictures directly from the front end can greatly enhance the user experience on your WordPress site. There are several ways to achieve this, so let’s dive in!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use a WordPress plugin for custom avatars</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are a powerful tool for managing custom avatars in WordPress. They offer additional features, ease of use, and seamless integration with other WordPress functionalities. Here’s a look at some of the top plugins you can use to let users change their profile pictures from the frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Profile Press</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/profile-press-download-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Profile Press download page\" class=\"wp-image-1916\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Profile Press</a> is a paid membership tool allowing admins to create custom user registration and login forms and a user profile section where registered visitors can change their profile pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Customization options for user profiles, registration forms, and more.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows users to reset their profile pictures, passwords, and other information.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows admins to curate a detailed member directory that is searchable and filterable.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin comes with many features, but it can be a bit more complicated for people who just want the option to change profile pictures. It’s also not free: The pricing starts from $129/year for 1 site, and even if you want the lite version, there’s still a 2% Stripe fee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Simple Local Avatars</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/simple-local-avatars-download-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Simple Local Avatars download page\" class=\"wp-image-1915\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-local-avatars/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simple Local Avatars</a> enables users to upload avatars directly to their profiles through the WordPress Media Library to manage images, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer keeping everything within their site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adds an avatar upload field to user profiles who have permission to do so.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Falls back on Gravatar if no custom picture is chosen.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stored the pictures in an “Upload” folder where the rest of your media is.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avatar Manager&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/avatar-manager-download-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Avatar Manager download page\" class=\"wp-image-1914\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/avatar-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar Manager</a> is a great solution for managing avatars. Users can choose between Gravatar, a custom-uploaded image, or a default-generated avatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Supports Gravatar and custom uploads.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option to fall back on default avatars if needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User-friendly profile interface.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avatar Manager is a free user-driven project and one of the most simple solutions if you want to give your users more control over their profile pictures in WordPress. However, it hasn’t been tested with the last three WordPress updates so make sure it’s fully compatible and working before integrating it into your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right plugin depends on your site’s specific needs and user preferences. Don’t hesitate to try out a few different options to see which one works best for your community. Each plugin offers unique features that can enhance how users interact with their profiles, making your site more engaging and user-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Explain to users how to change profile pictures via Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing profile pictures via Gravatar is the easiest method and doesn&#8217;t require installing anything on your WordPress site. However, not every user may be familiar with Gravatar or understand how it connects to their WordPress profile picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help your users navigate this process, consider providing a brief explanation of what Gravatar is and how it works with WordPress. You can include this information in a visible section on your website, such as the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/09/wordpress-profile-page/\">user profile page</a>, or the welcome email sent to new users upon registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what you might say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To change your profile picture on our site, you&#8217;ll need to create a Gravatar account. Gravatar, short for &#8216;Globally Recognized Avatar,&#8217; is a service that allows you to maintain a consistent profile picture across multiple websites, including WordPress sites like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, visit <a href=\"http://gravatar.com\">Gravatar.com</a> and sign up using the same email address associated with your account on our site. Once you&#8217;ve created your account, upload a new profile picture or choose from existing ones. Your chosen image will automatically update on our site and any other WordPress sites where you use the same email address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that changes might take some time to reflect due to caching. If you have any questions or need assistance, don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to our support team.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhance user profiles with deeper Gravatar integration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For admins looking to enhance the user experience, WordPress&#8217;s integration with Gravatar offers more than just profile pictures. With <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/rest-api/\">Gravatar&#8217;s REST API</a>, you can create detailed user profiles that display additional information alongside avatars. This API allows you to pull in data such as user bios, social media links, and more, providing a richer profile experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profiles-as-a-service-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar for developers homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1913\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another great feature to consider is <a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/profiles/hovercards/\">Gravatar Hovercards</a>. These pop-up cards display when someone hovers over a user&#8217;s avatar. Hovercards can show the user&#8217;s bio, social media links, and other Gravatar profile information. This adds an interactive element to your site, giving visitors more context about each user without navigating away from the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hovercards-example.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar hovercard\" class=\"wp-image-1912\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To implement Gravatar Hovercards, just add the following code to your website:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><a href=\"https://www.gravatar.com/js/hovercards/hovercards.min.js\">https://www.gravatar.com/js/hovercards/hovercards.min.js</a>\n&lt;script&gt;\n( function() {\n  function init() {\n    Gravatar.init();\n  }\n  if( document.readyState !== \'loading\') {\n    init();\n  } else {\n    document.addEventListener( \'DOMContentLoaded\', init );\n  }\n} )();\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating these features is straightforward and can provide a more personalized and engaging experience for your users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Get started today: Implement an effective profile picture system</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization is very important for websites that rely on user communication and engagement. The abovementioned plugins can be a great alternative to the default avatar system. However, keeping Gravatar as an option is beneficial because it allows users to transfer their digital identities easily with just an email, avoiding the need to create a new profile for each WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admins can further enhance the user experience by integrating Gravatar more deeply into their site. This can be done by using Gravatar&#8217;s REST API to provide additional profile information and features beyond avatars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When making a decision, consider your audience and what would serve them best.

When people have the option to interact with your content, they build a deeper connection with you as the author, and they also connect with other like-minded individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments are a valuable form of user-generated content that can boost your SEO by keeping your pages fresh and updated. However, managing comments can come with challenges like spam and moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll walk you through the steps of enabling and disabling comments, preventing spam, changing user avatars, filtering content, and using tools like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akismet</a> to enhance your comment section. By the end, you&#8217;ll have all the knowledge you need to create an engaging community around your WordPress blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to enable comments in WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enable comments on new posts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Go to <em>Settings &gt; Discussion</em>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/settings-discussion.png?w=660\" alt=\"Navigating to the discussion settings\" class=\"wp-image-1883\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enable the option for people to comment on new posts.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"156\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/allow-comments-on-new-posts.png?w=660\" alt=\"Default discussion settings for posts\" class=\"wp-image-1885\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Save your changes.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enable comments on specific posts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Navigate to <em>Posts &gt; All Posts</em> or <em>Pages &gt; All Pages</em>, depending on what you want to edit. We’ll go with a post in this example, but the process is the same for pages.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/posts-all-posts-gravatar.png?w=660\" alt=\"Navigating to the Posts list table\" class=\"wp-image-1886\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Choose the post or page and click <em>Edit</em>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/edit-post-gravatar.png?w=660\" alt=\"Editing an individual post\" class=\"wp-image-1887\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Go to the <em>Discussion</em> panel, which is located in the <em>Post</em> tab of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gutenberg</a> block editor, and click on <em>Allow comments</em>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/allow-comments-individual-post-gravatar.png?w=660\" alt=\"Allowing comments for a specific post\" class=\"wp-image-1888\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Click <em>Update</em> or <em>Publish</em>, and you’re done!</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling comments for a particular post or a page can be useful in many cases. For example, if you release a new big feature of your product or service, you can create a post announcing it and enable comments to gather feedback, while the comments for the regular updates stay disabled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to disable comments in WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While encouraging comment discussions can be great, you also need to make sure that your site has a clean and professional appearance. Sometimes that means disabling comments to prevent spam, inappropriate content, or heated debates on controversial topics. Disabling comments may also be necessary if you have limited moderation resources, want to maintain focus on your content, or have legal concerns. Ultimately, the decision depends on your unique situation and goals for your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disabling comments globally</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To disable comments for your entire site, go back to <em>Settings &gt; Discussion </em>and then uncheck the box that says “<em>Allow people to post comments on new articles</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"157\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/uncheck-allow-comments-global-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Disabling comments for all future posts\" class=\"wp-image-1889\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that this setting will only affect future published posts and pages, not the existing content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disabling comments on existing posts and pages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you have two options. You can either go back to the individual post settings and uncheck the <em>Allow comments </em>box, or you can do this in bulk for multiple posts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second option, do the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Select all the posts you wish to change the settings for.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/select-posts-to-edit.png?w=660\" alt=\"Selecting multiple posts for bulk editing\" class=\"wp-image-1890\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Click on the <em>Bulk Actions </em>dropdown menu, select <em>Edit</em>, and then click <em>Apply</em>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bulk-actions-edit.png?w=660\" alt=\"Bulk actions menu in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1891\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In the bulk edit window, find the settings for the comments and change them to <em>Do not allow</em>.

Instead, you can learn how to moderate comments through different methods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see them!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Accessing comment moderation settings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From your WordPress dashboard, go to <em>Settings &gt; Discussion</em> and there you will find more settings related to comment moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"247\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/other-comment-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Comment settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1893\" />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the options, for example, is to make the commenter fill out their name and email, but that isn’t always effective in deterring more dedicated spammers as they will just fill out a fake name and email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option is to limit comments only to registered users, which is great at first glance, but in reality, may discourage new users from engaging with your content. Not everyone wants to register for a site just to post a comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last content moderation feature here is closing comments on posts older than a number provided by you, for example, 14 days.

This is a great way to filter out spam and make sure only relevant comments are posted. However, it can be a bit overwhelming when your blog grows, and all of a sudden you have hundreds of comments to approve every day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do have regular readers, their comments will be automatically approved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keyword and phrase moderation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Further down, you’ll find a box where you can include a list of trigger words that will put comments for moderation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/content-moderation-and-links.png?w=660\" alt=\"Content moderation window in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1895\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Common spam keywords include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>CTAs</strong> like “<em>Act now!</em>”, “<em>Apply now!</em>”, “<em>Call now!</em>”, “<em>Don’t hesitate!</em>”, etc.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Almost anything including the word “Free”</strong>, such as <em>“free consultation”</em>, <em>“free offer”</em>, <em>“free trial”</em>, etc.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anything related to extra income</strong>, such as <em>“additional income”</em>, <em>“be your own boss”</em>, <em>“grow your business”</em>,<em> “double your”</em>, <em>“earn $”</em>, <em>“earn extra cash”</em>, <em>“earn from home”</em>, <em>“expect to earn”</em>, and many more.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the field above this box, you can also limit the number of links allowed in the comment, as one of the more common forms of spam includes links that prompt people to sign up for something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the option to directly delete comments with certain content, and it’s called “<em>Disallowed Comment Keys.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/disallowed-comment-keys.png?w=660\" alt=\"Disallowed Comment Keys box in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1896\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This setting allows you to include special keywords and phrases that signal spam and uncensored comments.

Just because a comment was flagged as spam does not always mean it is genuinely spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also recommended that you update your trigger words to include specific instances from your comment section, as well as email addresses, which are confirmed spammers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deep dive into avatar settings in WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The avatar settings in WordPress allow you to customize how users appear on your website. You can go there by navigating to <em>Settings &gt; Discussion</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/avatar-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Avatar settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-1898\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is connected to <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, a digital identity platform by Automattic, that allows users to create a unique profile connected to their email address. By default, WordPress pulls in user avatars from Gravatar, using the profile connected with the same email address. If they don’t have a Gravatar profile, a default picture will appear, which you can change from the same settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/default-avatar-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Default avatar options\" class=\"wp-image-1899\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, it’s recommended that you encourage users to create and customize their Gravatar profiles instead of staying anonymous. This will help with consistency on your website but also many other aspects:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personalization: </strong>Custom avatars allow users to express their identity and make discussions more engaging.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Recognition: </strong>Unique avatars help users recognize each other, fostering a sense of community.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Professionalism: </strong>For businesses, consistent branding with a logo avatar builds credibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Visual appeal: </strong>Avatars make comment sections more visually appealing and inviting for interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By encouraging users to create Gravatar profiles, you can drastically reduce the amount of spam you receive as Gravatar users are always connected with legitimate email addresses. Besides that, they are often linked with their social media accounts, which are automatically verified by the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profile-example-1-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1901\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/verified-accounts-gravatar.png?w=660\" alt=\"Linking verified social media accounts to a Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1903\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about how Gravatar profiles work, <a href=\"https://gravatar.com\">check out our documentation</a>!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tool to elevate comments sections on WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prevent spam with Akismet Anti-Spam</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jetpack-akismet.png?w=660\" alt=\"Akismet Anti-Spam homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1904\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akismet</a> is a tool by Jetpack created specifically to battle spam on WordPress sites. It comes packed with features that allow you to automate verification processes and create a distraction-free environment for your genuine users to engage and comment on posts and pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its main features include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Automatic spam detection: </strong>The plugin automatically detects and filters out spam comments, trackbacks, forum posts, WooCommerce product reviews, and contact form submissions. Everything is sent to the <em>Spam</em> folder.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Real-time monitoring:</strong> This feature captures spam right as it happens. Unwanted comments and submissions are automatically removed so that your site doesn’t include this type of content even for a second.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spam reporting:</strong> Users can teach Akismet by reporting spam directly from the WordPress dashboard, improving its accuracy and helping it learn your specific triggers. This way, no legitimate traffic is flagged as spam.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Full integration: </strong>The plugin easily integrates with popular contact form plugins like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP Forms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gravity Forms</a>, and more, and it also has a reliable spam protection network.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compliance with regulations: </strong>With Akismet, you can choose to display a privacy notice so that people are aware of their comments being scanned by a tool. This helps you become fully compliant with regulations like the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> in the European Union.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Its spam-protection capabilities work both on comments and form submissions so you can receive only relevant and real user interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage Gravatar profile integration for a better community</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profiles-as-a-service-1-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar – Profiles-as-a-service\" class=\"wp-image-1906\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WordPress’s default integration with Gravatar for pulling in user avatars, Gravatar’s REST API allows website owners and developers to <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">import user profile data</a> and build customized profile pages for their WordPress users. This powerful integration enhances the overall experience on comment threads by enabling users to visit commenter profiles and learn more about them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When integrated, the REST API gives you access to important user information such as:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Their profile bio</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Location&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Website URLs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payment links</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Verified social media profiles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional images</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And much more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With this data, however, WordPress site owners can create dynamic and informative <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/05/user-profile-page-examples/\">user profiles</a>, which can significantly improve the sense of community and encourage more meaningful interactions within comment sections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also great for the overall user experience because it gives your visitors a special place on your site without having to register and fill in the same information from scratch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great feature of Gravatar is the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2023/10/02/new-gravatar-hovercards-faster-open-source-and-everywhere/\">Hovercard</a> – a dynamic mini-version of a user’s Gravatar profile that shows up when you hover your mouse over their <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/19/wordpress-profile-picture/\">profile picture</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-comment-section.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar hovercard in a comment section of a blog post\" class=\"wp-image-1907\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This allows other site visitors to quickly access information about another user without leaving the page, giving them valuable context in the specific situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actively using and encouraging users to take advantage of Gravatar has the power to create strong communities that actively engage with each other.

You&#8217;re probably wondering what I&#8217;m doing here on The WordPress Way, DEIB. We decided to do something a little bit different this month. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you are going to be missing our wonderful host that is usually here, Birgit, but we thought this time let&#8217;s learn about Birgit. I mean, I&#8217;ve had a few hosts on different shows, and we&#8217;ve learned more about their journey, and it&#8217;s always fun, and I&#8217;ll probably even learn things I don&#8217;t know. So I am looking forward to it. So yeah, Birgit is here. Hello, Birgit, how you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Hello, Bob. I&#8217;m doing fine, thanks, and thanks for sharing the idea or turning tables. It&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s always fun. I did that in the very early years when we had three co-hosts. I did a kind of highlight. I called it Unplugged. Each one of them unplugged, and we just went through their own story and learned a little bit more about them. So I&#8217;m excited for it. And I think the best way to start is everybody&#8217;s always curious, especially some people because you&#8217;ve heard it so many times, but I don&#8217;t even know if I have heard how you got into WordPress or what drove you to WordPress. So why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Well, that is kind of funny, but also interesting for those who don&#8217;t know me yet, especially or didn&#8217;t see, I am a white woman almost 50 years now, and I&#8217;m a mom of five almost grown-up children, and I also have already two grandchildren. My ex-husband back in the day was a truck driver, so I was over the weekdays alone with all our children. And when my children went to bed, I had a lot of time to spend, and I was always a curious person. I learned about computers back in school, and I went to a business school and learned about Word, Excel, bookkeeping, all the stuff. And when we got our first personal computer, I was always in. And then when we got the internet, I was sucked in. I opened a new reel to my perception. So I need to preface this a little bit because it&#8217;s kind of funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a woman breastfeeding one of the children, sitting next to a computer in a chat room, and talking about stuff, and someone shared a link to a personal website. I was so stoked about that. I was so curious. Oh, I want to build websites myself. How does it function? I&#8217;m always a person who wants to look behind the curtains and how things work. And then I went down this rabbit hole, learning about HTML, how to build websites with iframes and tables. So crazy. And no, none of those websites are live anymore, so I can&#8217;t share them with the world today. But yeah, pivoting from HTML, and then you have to change everything. When you want to change, you have to change the navigation on every page when you build it in classic HTML and so on. And I was tired of that. So how can I get dynamic data too? So I learned about PHP and some frameworks and how to do that, and somehow I stumbled upon Typeform and B2/cafelog back in the day, and I was like, interesting. You can publish something and put it in the world without worrying about changing any hardcoded links to something. So I played with that, and then I learned that B2/cafelog would be discontinued, and it was forked by someone and called it WordPress. And I was one of the persons who installed WordPress on their web servers from this first release. I played around, but I wasn&#8217;t really serious about it yet back in the day. But in 2005, I was asked to build a website for someone. I didn&#8217;t use WordPress for building websites, just playing and fiddling around with my personal projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it meant I started to get self-employed as a side hustle to be more legal and serious about it. And since then, oh wow, always as a side hustle, I learned more about website building, and I didn&#8217;t have the chance to go to some form of professional training. Everything I know today I taught myself scrolling through the internet. Selfhtml.de was one of my plates. I learned a lot about just asking questions and checking other blog posts. And then when YouTube started to be a thing, I learned about that. I also experimented with Joomla, Drupal, Typo3, which is more popular in Germany, and so on. I also managed one time I was working with a primary direct marketing with call center and address data management and so on. I went to my boss one day and told him, our website sucks, it doesn&#8217;t look very good. And he told me, okay, come up with a new concept. I did it in one week, and then I founded the web design department in that company. Wow. I pivoted from a mom with five children learning HTML and designing websites in the afternoon and when the kids are asleep or something to running a web design department in a small business company, we had around 150 employees back in the day. So building websites and also later building apps and using WordPress as a data management backend. When REST API became a thing, I&#8217;m more of a generalist because I have multiple interests. Maybe my divergent traits come into play on that. But on the other hand, it&#8217;s ongoing consistency in my life building websites and fiddling around with new stuff and maybe sometimes running after the new shiny objects. So I&#8217;m kind of weak for these shiny objects, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s always sparking new ideas and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is how I came to WordPress. And then I was building websites. And then I found a theme framework called the Extreme theme, which was utilizing back in the day the YAML CSS framework. It&#8217;s like today, the Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS framework. But YAML was the other part, and it&#8217;s kind of a page builder theme back in the day. I was really interested and founded by a German workforce engineer. He unfortunately passed away too early back in the years, but I was part of the forum members. We grew friendship over that. And someday he talked about, oh, I&#8217;m going to a WordCamp in Berlin, and you need to come. And I was, Ooh, I am a girl in a rural area in western Germany, and I have five children. I don&#8217;t go to a big city like Berlin. But somehow I managed to go to the WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met with the people I adored back in the day, people who ran blogs like Frank Bültge, co-founder of Inpsyde. I learned that those people are normal people like you and me. But somehow back in the day, I put people on a pedestal because I looked up to them. But on the other hand, it was really good. This stoked me with the WordPress community. It was my first encounter, and this was 2010, and I was infected by the WordPress event virus. I needed to go to WordCamp. Then I learned about, oh, you can contribute to WordPress, to the project, and you can help with that. And so we grew, and then 2011 was my next WordCamp in Cologne, which is more nearby in my hometown. But also 2011, a big pivot year in my personal life because I finally separated from my then-husband living in a toxic marriage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lost a good friend of mine to cancer in the same year. Two years earlier, my mom died. So there was so much going on in my life, but WordPress and building websites were always a consistent pillar in my life. Then I met Robert Windisch, you know him, the man with the hat, the other hat. Robert was also one of the founding partners of a site back in the day called Inpsyde. In 2009, I specialized in training WordPress instead of just building websites, and I ran individual training for small business owners and small companies and so on. I joined forces with them in 2012, first as a self-employed contract trainer, and later they took the leap and employed me on a part-time job. One of the first tasks when I&#8217;m not training, I should have maintained the translations for WordPress in German.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t know how that works, I need to go into that because it&#8217;s really important. The agency site was founded because of some people who joined forces and translating WordPress back in the day was translating in the code. Can you imagine translating and changing the original code? It&#8217;s a no-go today. So for everyone who doesn&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t work and edit core software. They started a community forum, and over that, they grew and got asked for contracts and so on. They built a company. That is a long time ago, but over the years, they always maintained the German translation for WordPress in two variants. One is the informal, it&#8217;s the default version, but also the formal translation for formal speech. In Germany, we have two different forms of that. So it means you need to maintain two language sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day, we also needed to alter some files of the core software before we could release a German language pack and the German compiled version. When I started translating WordPress as an employee of Inpsyde or outside, I learned how to compile WordPress. Imagine, a tired Birgit. The kids are asleep, and I&#8217;m sitting there waiting in the IRC chat room for the WordPress core to get the announcement that a new version was released because then I needed to go to compile the translation files. I prepared and tested beforehand with the original file, and then go to the backend of WordPress.org and compile a package and then push the button for release. So imagine this kind</p>\n\n\n\n<p>of sweating, dripping experience in the middle of the night because the majority of the developers were sitting in the US, based more in San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the time zone shift to Germany was something. So it&#8217;s gotten easier over the years, but this experience and my natural curiosity, which comes with my larger divergent trait, was always leading the path where I am currently now. So contributing to WordPress and building communities, fostering relationships. So in 2013, when Remkus de Vries and Zé Fontainhas founded the WordCamp Europe, this was my first international WordCamp. So in 2013, 11 years ago, that opened another gate. In 2013, I was privileged with the travel assistance program, or I learned about the travel assistance program for the community summit, and I traveled to WordCamp San Francisco and Community Summit in 2014. This was my first touchdown on US soil. That&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s so crazy. Given the fact that I, as a mom of five children, divorced back in 2014, I was just joining a new partnership after three years of being a single parent and leaving my children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority were already older now, but my youngest was eight and a half years old, my youngest, back in 2014. Also, being a person with mobility issues, it is kind of challenging to travel internationally. But this is a backstory of how I got involved with WordPress and how I started contributing to WordPress and fell in love with the community. I really fell because I care a lot about the people. And that brings me to today, why I am so advocating for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Because I come from a position where I had to think about how I can feed my children the next day. So low income because of different circumstances, having a part-time job over all the years, not filling the fridge and dealing with a toxic marriage and so on, getting no child support and all the stuff. I know how it feels to be not that privileged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if I&#8217;m living in a privileged country, I live in Germany, I&#8217;m in a pretty safe space. We have a decent healthcare system. But still, given all that, I see a lot of injustice, and where I see injustice, I am going to fight for that. I try to be the voice for those who can&#8217;t raise their voices, even if it&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s introverted or doesn&#8217;t know where to speak or who to speak with to change things. A good friend of mine phrased it. I&#8217;m some kind of an overarching glue to all within the community because as someone who&#8217;s a generalist and not a specialist in a certain area, I know a lot, but on the surface, only in certain areas, I&#8217;m more likely to dive deep. But yeah, so that is helping to connect. I&#8217;m more the person who connects others, and that is why I&#8217;m advocating so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m also not shy to speak out when I see there&#8217;s injustice. But I also try to consider and not to dive into some kind of drama. Even if I see drama unfold on social media like Twitter or X now or whatever it&#8217;s called today, I try to find all voices within this drama and see, okay, what is this side? What is this side? Where do we have some kind of overlap? And then I try to be constructive with my feedback. So I don&#8217;t want to fuel the fire, but not shutting down the fire but giving it direction in a productive way. And that is why I&#8217;m always asking to have some kind of an overview above the organization of the WordPress open source ecosystem, how we can make sure that everyone is treated equally, that everyone gets the same chance even if they don&#8217;t have the same starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So especially WordPress as an open-source system. And when you see I am with WordPress since its first release, I saw a lot of progress, but still, we have so many areas where you don&#8217;t have to know how to code and that is not that obvious. But on the other hand, it&#8217;s also not so attractive for some companies to put money on those areas of the WordPress ecosystem where there&#8217;s also a lot of work to do. And since I&#8217;m thinking about this accessibility team, which makes sure that the software project and everything issues like needing to raise assistive technology, but also for someone with neurodivergence is the UX and so on. The next part is documentation. How many contributors do we have which are sponsored to document our fast-pacing software development, but also community and making sure that areas like the DEIB within WordPress so that the DEIB principles can be applied in the daily work of the majority of people who are volunteers so they don&#8217;t get some formal training on how to behave, even if it might be common sense in certain areas of the world to treat people nicely and kindly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a worldwide project which also has a lot of different cultures and histories and sees the diversity not only in the color of the skin, diversity also the diverse range of age, the diverse range of knowledge where people are coming from. So when I compare myself with a core developer who got some formal training at MIT, for instance, so I can&#8217;t compare myself, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m self-educated, but on the other hand, I have traits and knowledge in other areas where we can combine those and create a better experience for everyone. So yeah, it&#8217;s a long story to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />A lot to unpack there. Yeah, and one of the interesting things, you went through a lot of different phases, you touched on a lot of different things there. No wonder we connected so well. You and I have so many similarities, just not in the timeline, but in attitude and how we feel about things. I think you started with the first release, and I started like you, just dabbling in 2006. The interesting thing with me was I&#8217;d already been doing marketing, running a marketing company for 17 years prior to WordPress. In the, I believe it was, I don&#8217;t know if it was the mid or late eighties, I took a year of computer programming. I thought I needed to learn this. So I spent a year learning Cobol, Assembly Language, FORTRAN, and Basic, and it was absolutely a nightmare to me. I mean, I was fascinated by computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved doing what I could do, but getting inside of them, opposite of you, was fearful. It was like, whoa. But having done that got me very comfortable with computers too, which I don&#8217;t regret spending that year because it just felt like I got it more than some people. And unlike you, I went in kicking and screaming into any kind of building sites, doing HTML, just horrible flash sites for a couple of clients. I knew I had to get into it owning a marketing and design business. I&#8217;d been doing print design for so many years, but when I found WordPress in 2006 and started playing with it, it was mostly around the blogging part that fascinated me. I was already into content. My wife was already doing stuff on Typepad, and she had an award-winning blog way back in the days. I discovered WordPress as a rescue for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was like, wow, I can build a site using one of these themes. I got a theme from iThemes, one of their early themes, shortly after they started, and I built our own little brochure site. I thought, wow, this thing actually looks professional now and I can make changes. So I was forced into it, not so much ever really wanting to dive in. I was curious about the code, but not so curious as wanting to do it yet. I&#8217;ll leave that to the other people that want to do that and are good at it. But just all the things. My first WordCamp was in 2010, San Francisco. A lot of similarities. It&#8217;s amazing. Just how you got into contributing. I did kind of the different side of things. It wasn&#8217;t like official contributions, but it was educating, consulting, writing, being more of a teacher and trainer in WordPress all those years. So we both went on similar paths. We&#8217;ve been privileged, but in the sense that we went through some very rough times in our business and stuff, and some really tense times, and you have more empathy. I feel like I have it because I am always thinking of the other person and how they feel versus just what I&#8217;m thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting and you mentioned something about this empathy part, but also caring a lot about other people. And when I had some rough times, I mentioned I went from a toxic marriage to being a single parent and fighting for the rights of my children, et cetera. I&#8217;m very vocal about my history and sometimes I was so hard struggling with my mental health and also all the stuff going on in my life. But as I mentioned, WordPress and the community are always some of the stable pillars in my life, and I&#8217;ve spoken about that already. I shared it in some talks at a WordCamp. WordPress literally saved my life at some point in my life where maybe I said a trigger warning. I had moments in my life where I was questioning if it&#8217;s worthwhile to stay alive and then I just vented it out and spoke to someone and I reached out to someone and they immediately jumped in and supported me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a moment in my life where I always tear up when I&#8217;m sharing that, even in the darkest moments, when you have the courage to reach out to someone, even if it&#8217;s a stranger on the internet, you may have built a relationship over the internet. But so many people in this community jumped in supporting me. The recent example was collecting funds so that I could afford to travel to WordCamp Europe and to Sweden this year. The WordPress community has my back all the time when I reach out and am vocal about and share my vulnerability. So to be vulnerable is not a bad thing. As long as we turn our</p>\n\n\n\n<p>vulnerability into something we can grow and build upon, and create more empathy for someone else who may have a similar struggle. I learned about that my crowdfunding campaign this year to go to WordCamp Europe inspired someone to take action in another similar direction and also see their initiatives like the WP Community Collective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They got inspired by the crowdfunding campaign to fund contributors to travel to WordCamps. We have great initiatives that support speakers to travel to WordCamps, but someone who is contributing to WordPress and doesn&#8217;t have, maybe due to several facts, the ability to afford to travel, but to be accepted as the speaker at a WordCamp. That is something I learned about, even if I shared my vulnerability, not to earn empathy, but just to share, Hey, I feel this way now. So if someone has something to spare, I&#8217;m really appreciative of this. But thinking about looking back on that, how much this might have positively affected someone else. So in retrospect, everything I touched in my life had somehow affected someone else&#8217;s life. That is how I always also try to be alert to everything I do, how someone else&#8217;s life may be influenced by that. I&#8217;m not forcing that, but I try to consider every decision I make, does this affect someone else negatively? That is what you say about empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, exactly. Let&#8217;s step back and put ourselves in this person&#8217;s shoe or from this person&#8217;s view or whatever, because a lot of times what&#8217;s being said or what&#8217;s being told, we&#8217;ve all been there. And that&#8217;s the thing a lot of people lose is the ability to go back and say, oh, I remember when I was in that spot. Like you said, traveling between costs of just traveling, especially if you&#8217;re traveling internationally, you&#8217;re taking a day or two on each end just to get there. And then you&#8217;ve got the actual event and you&#8217;re away for a week. So not only are you spending money for a lot of these people, they&#8217;re not making money during that time. They don&#8217;t have the luxury of being given the time off for something. They have to close down shop and do that thing, even though that may be productive and helpful to their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Exactly. And thinking of traveling, especially for someone with mobility issues, I need to plan ahead every move because walking distances is still kind of challenging. Even if I now have two hip replacements,<br />Mechanically, I can walk, but my body isn&#8217;t used yet to this kind of movement. So it takes a while to get on board. Again, as someone with neurodivergent traits, I like to know where I&#8217;m going and what kind of obstacles I may face and how to get from A to B in the most effective way so it doesn&#8217;t drain my energy too much so I can be alert when I&#8217;m there. But it&#8217;s still also overwhelming meeting new people and a lot of people at events like WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US, or WordCamp Asia. These are the flagship events with 2,000 or 3,000 attendees. And also traveling abroad internationally, it&#8217;s always challenging to the body, even if someone is healthy and fit.<br />It&#8217;s draining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s brutal, is what it is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />So thinking of someone who has more mobility issues or someone who has more weight on their bones than someone else, finding a good safe spot to sit. I experienced entering some chairs with very unfortunate positions of armrests and so on, which my butt didn&#8217;t fit in really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of difficult to sit down, but on the other hand, I can&#8217;t assume that everyone can acknowledge that beforehand, but I can share my experience. For instance, I tend to speak to WordCamp organizers, especially WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US, to make sure that there are enough seating positions also in the hallways so that people who might need to take a rest, especially for someone we are barely out of the pandemic, and the pandemic showed up that someone who was infected with this viral infection can suffer from syndromes like chronic fatigue. You don&#8217;t see that when someone is challenged with chronic fatigue syndrome. So you have to take a rest because you are going out of breath when you are walking 20 meters or 30 meters, so you may need to take a rest. So to make sure that the WordCamp event or the WordPress event venue accommodates the situation, not only do we need accessible restrooms, and hopefully the cleaning staff doesn&#8217;t put any cleaning supplies within the accessible restrooms so that someone with a wheelchair can&#8217;t navigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is also an example when you see something where you see, okay, this might affect someone else. Going back to the empathy part, if you see something, maybe the instance I experienced at WordCamp Europe on the first conference day and I went to the restroom as someone with mobility issues, I prefer accessible restrooms because they&#8217;re more convenient to use, even if I don&#8217;t have a wheelchair. But not having a wheelchair is not an excuse not to use accessible restrooms for everyone who wants to judge why someone is using an accessible restroom. Even if they can walk, there may have other reasons to use an accessible restroom, just to note. But I imagine I witnessed that the cleaning staff had their cart with all the cleaning supplies and if someone with a wheelchair would have accessed the room, they wouldn&#8217;t have had any chance to navigate through that because the washing thing was blocked. I reported that immediately to the organizing team, and they went to the venue facility manager and it was solved the next day because it was the end of the event. But yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I was just thinking those wet floor signs that they put out too could be a real issue because they have to try to put it somewhere where you can see it, but that could be right in the way too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yeah, exactly. And that is something when you see, and that is why I urge everyone to first use common sense, then ask yourself, does this affect someone else negatively? I can&#8217;t expect that everyone knows everything, but if you have someone in your family or friend surroundings who may have faced some issues, try to be advocating for their convenience if possible. We can&#8217;t please everyone to be fair, so we can do as much as possible even if we can&#8217;t accommodate everything and include everyone and everything. But to be in a balance and make it, because there&#8217;s a saying, talking about also WordPress websites, having accessible WordPress websites, it&#8217;s not only benefiting those who need it but benefits everyone. Accessibility benefits everyone. And that is also true for venue traveling, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. Yeah. Well, this has been great because this has not only been learning about everything you do or have done and then how you got into your passion around what you&#8217;re doing on this show but also a conversation about it. So it was just a very nice rounded chat we had. And we can see why you do this once a month on here at Do the Woo. So this is very cool and I appreciate being able to turn the table and I think everybody likes to learn a little bit more about our hosts. And I&#8217;m just going to throw this out. It&#8217;s a little bit of an opportunity. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk about it regarding our news site. So for those of you that listen to various shows, we do have a way now we have our sponsors, which I adore, and they make this whole thing possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is another way of giving back to this show and that is supporting each specific show. And what that means is you can go in and you can give a one-time gift or you can subscribe for a couple of different amounts, but that money actually will go to the host of the show. It doesn&#8217;t go into running the show or anything. And as Birgit mentioned, she&#8217;s been lucky to have the support of the community. And that&#8217;s what this is going to be. It will either help the hosts themselves with their contributions, the time they spend on that, their travel. And for some of our hosts, maybe they don&#8217;t feel they need that because of their position and where they are at this time in their life. And they&#8217;ll say, Hey, let&#8217;s give it to one of these related WordPress organizations that do help speakers and contributor travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve been listening to a show and you&#8217;re really getting into it and you want to give something back to that show&#8217;s host, we&#8217;ll pull that together, figure out what to do with it, and you&#8217;re actually supporting them because they&#8217;re driving all the shows and they&#8217;re doing all the front face work and stuff. I&#8217;m just running behind the scenes doing all the other stuff, except occasionally I come in and have the opportunity to do great interviews and chats with my friends like this. So I appreciate it. And yeah, this has been absolutely wonderful. Anything you want to say before we sign off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yeah, on the first end, I really want to thank you again, Bob first for creating this kind of great show and place to learn, but also offering the spot for people like me to talk about topics we care about a lot, but also giving someone else a voice where they can share also their story and learnings so that everyone can benefit from that. I am also very appreciative of all the work you are doing in the backend, which is not seen by everyone. So a special shout out again to you, but for the listeners, I want to say if you want to go and make a difference, there are several ways you can join the WordPress community and you don&#8217;t need to know how to code. There are certain areas where you can contribute your time and knowledge. And if you have any questions, please reach out to me. I&#8217;m Coach Birgit on all the socials on the Make WordPress Slack. Also, you can reach out to Bob if you have any questions. We are really happy to guide you in the right direction where you can contribute your passion to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well, thank you and thank everyone for listening. If you&#8217;re not subscribed, you can subscribe to the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>old channel, or you can just subscribe to your favorite show. And we are trying to push more people back to commenting. This is my own little mission. I would love for you to come in on the post and comment and share your thoughts on anything we talked about. Of course, Birgit is always looking for wonderful guests that want to come in and talk around the issue of DEIB. So please consider that as well. And my final thank you to Birgit for being a wonderful guest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Thank you for being a wonderful host.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this special episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way, DEIB</em></strong>, <strong>BobWP</strong> turns the tables and has a chat with our regular host, <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/host/birgit-olzem/\">Birgit Olzem</a></strong>. You will learn about Birgit&#8217;s fascinating journey with WordPress, from her early days of learning HTML while caring for her children to becoming a pivotal contributor and advocate for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging within the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit shares her personal story of overcoming challenges, building a career in web design, and finding strength and support in the WordPress community. This episode is a heartfelt exploration of her passion, resilience, and dedication to fostering a more inclusive and empathetic tech space. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit&#8217;s Journey to WordPress:</strong> Birgit&#8217;s journey began with her curiosity about computers and web design, leading her to discover WordPress and become an early adopter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community Support:</strong> The WordPress community has been a consistent pillar of support for Birgit, providing assistance during her challenging times and helping her attend events through crowdfunding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB):</strong> Birgit is a strong advocate for DEIB within the WordPress community, driven by her own experiences of overcoming adversity and recognizing the importance of equitable opportunities for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contributing to WordPress:</strong> Birgit&#8217;s contributions to WordPress include translating the software into German, founding a web design department, and providing training to small business owners. She emphasizes that contributing doesn&#8217;t always require coding skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Empathy and Advocacy:</strong> Birgit&#8217;s personal struggles have instilled a deep sense of empathy, driving her to fight against injustice and advocate for those who may not have a voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges of Traveling with Mobility Issues:</strong> Birgit highlights the difficulties faced by individuals with mobility issues when traveling to events and emphasizes the need for accessible accommodations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact of Vulnerability:</strong> Sharing her vulnerabilities has not only brought Birgit personal support but also inspired others in the community to take action and support each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Role of the WordPress Community:</strong> The WordPress community is depicted as a supportive and inclusive space where individuals can find help, build relationships, and contribute to a larger mission.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 08:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: Happy Birthday, Charleen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=117889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2024/07/happy-birthday-charleen/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4859:\"<p>I&#8217;ve had many blessings in my life, but the very first was the family I was born into. Today, I&#8217;d like to tell you about my only sibling, favorite sister, and best beloved, <a href=\"https://charleen.mullenweg.com/\">Charleen Mullenweg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a gap of nine and a half years between us, we could have easily been distant from each other, but it was almost like I had a third parent, one who was just the coolest person I could imagine in the universe. My sister paved the way for me, giving my parents lots of experience and training, so they were pretty chill by the time I came along. As a very young kid, I didn&#8217;t always understand what was going on. For example, one time, I remember getting jealous of all the gifts she was getting&#8230; gifts given after a really intense surgery for severe scoliosis (twisted spine) that required her to wear a brace for many years. She was always gracious and understanding towards the little kid following her around everywhere and trying to be like her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Charleen never wavered in being my biggest supporter, despite how annoying I must have been as an eager kid a decade her junior. All of my early aesthetic and musical tastes were derivative of her early discovery of cool bands like The Police, U2, Counting Crows, and Concrete Blonde. Despite being labeled with her initials, I&#8217;d &#8220;borrow&#8221; all her CDs and tapes. We&#8217;d make each other mixes and share books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve never doubted that no matter what I did, Charleen would always back me up, as she said &#8220;I&#8217;m behind you 1000%.&#8221; I missed her dearly when she moved to Austin in the 90s, far before everyone else figured out how cool Austin was, but that just meant countless road trips to visit and crash on her couch. The distance didn&#8217;t keep her from being there for every holiday and major event, including when I started to have jazz performances or host technology events in town. Whatever my interest was, she was there and supportive. As WordCamps started to become a thing, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/05/wordcamp-sf-2009-2/mcm_0647-2/\">she was there</a>. I always knew however much I messed up or people were mad at me (there were lots!) I could look out and see my sister&#8217;s face, there to comfort me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her influence on me didn&#8217;t stop with music and art. Charleen&#8217;s early research into genealogy, which included deep dives into libraries and making rubbings of gravestones, couldn&#8217;t be more perfect for my first foray into relational databases. We learned together how to set up the structures in MySQL and phpMyAdmin to represent all of the genealogical information in tables, which complemented the PHP I was learning to <a href=\"https://mullenweg.com/\">create Mullenweg.com</a>, still up today. Before I built any other content management systems the first content I was managing was Charleen&#8217;s and my Uncle Colin&#8217;s research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a sibling and want to be as awesome as Charleen, start with this: Unflappable, unwavering support, and honesty. My entrepreneurial path was not straight up and to the right: It included many twists and turns, close calls, borrowing money, huge mistakes, but I always knew Charleen was a phone call away. Her sharp intellect was able to slice through whatever I was struggling with, able to back and support me however I needed in that situation. You can jump further when you feel like you have a safety net, and my family has always been that for me. There have been times when it felt like the entire internet was calling for my head, nobody liked me, I couldn&#8217;t do anything right, but Charleen was always there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say there&#8217;s family you choose and family that you&#8217;re born with. Well, if there&#8217;s any sliver of truth to the idea from a movie like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(2020_film)\">Pixar&#8217;s Soul</a> that you have some choice in the matter of where you end up being born, I&#8217;m delighted that I chose to be born as a little brother to Charleen. Because we saw so many other examples of familial relationships torn asunder, we never wanted that to happen to us, so we&#8217;ve always maintained that ability to just let things go that don&#8217;t really matter as much as your lifelong bond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charleen, thank you for a lifetime of love and support, from my first breaths to our latest adventures.

Eneko is a full stack developer who has made</p>\n\n\n\n<p>significant contributions to the WordPress community since attending his first WordCamp in 2019. Eneko&#8217;s journey with WordPress began when he attended WordCamp Bilbao during a challenging time in his life, marked by anxiety and depression. This pivotal experience, not only transformed his career, but also enriched his personal life. Leading him to become a passionate contributor and advocate for the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off by discussing Eneko&#8217;s initial encounter with WordCamp Bilbao, where he felt a profound sense of belonging, and support from the vibrant WordPress community. Despite his initial hesitations, Eneko was drawn to the inclusive and welcoming environment, which motivated him to participate more actively in future WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eneko goes on to share how his role as a polyglot contributor for the Basque locale has been a consistent source of joy and purpose. His commitment to translating WordPress into Basque has not only helped the community, but also deepened his connection to his cultural heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the impact that word process had on Eneko&#8217;s life, from opening new career opportunities to fostering lasting friendships. Eneko credits the WordPress community with providing him with a supportive network that has helped him navigate various challenges, including his autism diagnosis in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we discuss Eneko&#8217;s preparations for delivering a talk at WordCamp Europe, a testament to his growth and confidence since this first WordCamp experience. Despite the daunting prospect of speaking to a large audience, Eneko remains resolute and grateful for the supportive community that has been instrumental in his journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in hearing a heartfelt story about the life-changing potential of the WordPress community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Eneko Garrido.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Eneko Garrido. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;m here in Torino today, and we are enjoying WordCamp Europe together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you been to any WordCamps before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Yes. WordCamps, yes, but this is my first WordCamp Europe. My first WordCamp was in 2019, that was WordCamp Bilbao. And since then, I tried to go to any WordCamp that I could. Today I&#8217;m here thanks to Yoast, because Yoast fund me with the diversity fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, nice. I did not know that, but that&#8217;s really nice to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community in Spain, by all accounts, is really strong at the moment. I know that a lot of countries have gone into a state of decline, really. Certainly in the UK, a lot of the events that were happening, 2019 was the last time they happened, and then Covid came and it didn&#8217;t really come back. But my understanding is that in Spain, it&#8217;s still a very vibrant community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you mentioned WordCamp in Bilbao. That&#8217;s going to be the main thing that we&#8217;re going to talk about today, because you&#8217;re doing an intriguing talk at WordCamp Europe. But before we get into that, will you just tell us a little bit about you. Stay away from the WordCamp Bilbao thing, but just tell us what you do on a daily basis. What&#8217;s your relationship with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Okay, so I am a full stack developer. I have been working for the Renfe Group as a full stack developer. The Renfe Group is the Spanish railway company, the Spanish state owned railway company. Nowadays, I am not working because I left that job, and I live in Bilbao. So I am currently searching for new opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you for telling us all about that. So first of all, I&#8217;m just going to read off my piece of paper in front of me, about what the subject is going to be. And just to let you know, dear listener, I often go through the WordCamp presentation titles, and I find ones that I think are going to be of interest to the listeners to this podcast, and I picked Eneko&#8217;s one, and let&#8217;s see how this conversation goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally I write down a whole ton of questions, and I know more or less what I&#8217;m going to ask. But in this case, it&#8217;s going to be more of a conversation. We&#8217;ll see where it goes. And it goes like this. So the podcast discussion subject, how the WordPress community changed my life: how joining the community after having a bad lifetime changed the way to see the world. And it sounds like, at some point in the past, you were having a difficult time. And then you discovered that there was a thing called WordCamp Bilbao, you attended, and in your own words, the community changed your life. So let&#8217;s go back, rewind the clock, tell us the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:09] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> So in 2019 I was finishing my compulsory studies in Spain. I was 16 year old little person that was simply trying to finish the studies, and because of some sort of depression, anxiety, I had to leave the college. I repeated that course okay. Then I was at home, and I seen on the WordPress dashboard of my own website that I run, that one event was near me, that was WordCamp Bilbao.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that moment, I was living in Pamplona, the city that I have born on. I seen WordCamp Bilbao, and I thought, what is this? I asked my parents, and they looked me like, where are you going? They said to me, do whatever you want. As you are not going classes and you are all day in bed, you can take the bus, go to the grandfather&#8217;s house that is in Bilbao, it&#8217;s the place that I am currently living, and go to that WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first day of that WordCamp was a little bit strange, because was in a maritime museum. I didn&#8217;t went there in my life. There was three tracks. One that was announced as basic. The other one was as advanced, and the other one was, I don&#8217;t know what was announced like. It was a little bit strange because I was there alone, didn&#8217;t know anything and anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day passed with some few things that I remember. The person that was here seated, Fernando Tellado, he wasn&#8217;t going to that specific WordCamp, and that was a little strange thing, because Fernando Tellado has normally goes to every WordCamp in Spain, and I didn&#8217;t know who was Fernando Tellado. And I remember the moment that someone went to the stage and said, now we are going to call Fernando Tellado by phone, because Fernando Tellado is not here. We are going to call him, and talk with him in a moment. And was like, but who is Fernando Tellado? And later on I discovered who was Fernando Tellado, and then I understand everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the moment when I connected really with the community. Was a moment on the contributor day. On the contributor day, I didn&#8217;t know neither what it was. In Bilbao 2019, the contributor day was on the Sunday, okay? So the talks were on Saturday, and the contributor today on Sunday. Because in Spain, normally we do like that. Here in Torino has been the other way. Going to the contributor day, didn&#8217;t know what that was, with my computer on the backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen that was like some tables, with some topics like community, core, polyglots, design, all sort of things like that. And I choose the polyglots table. That was my first contributor day table. And then on the contributor day table, I met Luis Rull, that is also from the Spanish community. He&#8217;s a local manager of Spanish from Spain. He taught me to translate WordPress. And since then, every month I contribute to the WordPress translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember that he took a photo, and published it on Twitter, and said, here is Eneko Garrido, 16 year old person that is a few months older than WordPress, and he&#8217;s here contributing to WordPress. And I remember that he mentioned to Matt. And that moment, I was like, who is Matt? So that was my first WordCamp experience. Until the contributor day, I didn&#8217;t network with anyone really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is one thing that I said, all the WordCamps, it must be compulsory to go to contributor day, especially for the new people on the community, on the new people that is the first WordPress event. They have to be on the contributor day, because it&#8217;s the day where people is talking, is doing networking. It&#8217;s not like in that hour I have to be on that room, because here talks, I don&#8217;t know. Francisco Torres, who is a very plugin guy, who&#8217;s going to talk about the plugins team. I don&#8217;t know, I think that the contributor day should be mandatory for the first time persons on WordPress event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. So the event that we are at now is three days long. The main event is two days long, and then there&#8217;s contributor day at the beginning. And exactly as you said, it&#8217;s the one day where more or less everybody&#8217;s in the same room at the same time, and they&#8217;re free to divert their attention, if you walk over and have a conversation with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, on the other two days, a lot of people are in conversations in the hallway, but also a lot of people are in presentations, and everybody&#8217;s got to be quiet, and you&#8217;re listening to the speaker and all that. So I completely get what you mean. The contributor day is a really important thing if you want to socialise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I just go back, and you may not wish to reveal any of what I&#8217;m about to ask, and if you don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s fine, and we&#8217;ll exclude it from the podcast. But I&#8217;m just curious as to what was going on in your life at that time? Because I want to get to a point where we see the contrast between then and now. Because it feels like that is the story, the contrast of what you were like as that 16 year old, spending time in the house. It sounds from what you were saying that you didn&#8217;t get up, and didn&#8217;t have a lot of motivation, or interest and what have you. Are you willing to tell us what was going on? You don&#8217;t have to give us everything. You don&#8217;t have to give us anything, but if you are willing, then please feel free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:49] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> At that time, I was, as I said, finishing the studies. Through all my life, practically, I have suffered from bullying at the school. So going to school was, every day was, making harder for me. At that time I was having anxiety issues, some anxiety attacks in class. I had to quit from classes in the middle of the explanations of the teacher. And that was also because of my autism. I am autistic, and until 2021 I didn&#8217;t get an official diagnosis. That was the time that I went to the adult psychiatrist, because the young people psychiatrist of the public Spanish system, if you don&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re autistic when you born, they don&#8217;t say until you are 18 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at 2021 my psychiatrist said that, and from that time I started knowing me more, and understanding more things about me, like my ironies that I don&#8217;t catch. The ironies that people don&#8217;t catch about me. My really fear to socialise, fear and difficulty also to socialise. And until then I didn&#8217;t understand that much about me. That was probably why I was passing a bad time, and I decided to go to a WordCamp that I saw on my webpage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just unpack that a little bit. So you&#8217;re obviously inside WordPress, you must have a website or something at this point, because you can see the dashboard. It may be that if you&#8217;re listening to this, you may have disabled this feature, but there&#8217;s a feature in the dashboard by default of WordPress, which is events. And it will geolocate, and it will tell you if there&#8217;s things coming up nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s text on a screen. How on earth did you summon up the, let&#8217;s use the word courage, to see the text on the screen and think, yeah, that sounds like it could be, I don&#8217;t know, fun or whatever? Because, from everything that you said, my imagination goes to, you&#8217;ll see that, think, okay, there&#8217;s a WordCamp in Bilbao, I&#8217;m not going to that. What pushed you over the edge, because that sounds like an incredibly big jump?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> The thing that pushed me to the edge really was the, not the word, the camp. So the part camp of the word WordCamp was what pushed me to the edge, because sounds like something more interesting than meet up. When I listen meet up, I say, okay, so meet up. People join together, and people that know each other join together to talk about something, okay. But when you listen the WordCamp, you think about the school camps. The camps that your parents send you on in summer. And I said, oh, that WordPress camp, oh, that must be very interesting. I could learn about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I clicked on WordCamp Bilbao, on the link, and that sent me to the WordCamp Bilbao page. And I saw, oh, there is a program with two days of things. I don&#8217;t know who is going to talk about, I don&#8217;t know, SEO, or security, or performance, but it seems very interesting this. That pushed me, and I said, okay, 20 Euros, perfect. The best 20 Euros I have spent on my life really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really remarkable. Also I&#8217;ve never heard it, you know, the WordCamp being such a profound change there. It associated in your head with, I don&#8217;t know, fun, or having something a little bit different. So you took yourself there, you got in the room, it was the contributor day, and I&#8217;m guessing from everything that you described about your relationship with being sociable, and I think you said you find that difficult to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did you overcome that? Because I can also imagine you arriving at the venue and getting to the stairs and thinking, I&#8217;m just going to go home. So in you go. Was it a welcoming environment? Did you immediately connect with people, or was it a much more slow process? Where at the end of it you thought, well, that wasn&#8217;t too bad, or was it, well, that was fabulous, or somewhere in between?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:00] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> The first thing that I think of when I arrived to WordCamp Bilbao was the doors opening, because I arrived like five minutes before the opening, so I was like the first after the volunteers and organisers. I&#8217;ve seen ,the sponsors stands and I was like, woah, this is serious. This is a conference. Woah, there are hosting companies here. I have a contract with that people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was like, I don&#8217;t know, they give me a bag, they give me a T-shirt, they give me some stickers. I saw also the WordPress logo with the pride flag on a pin. And that was like, woah, what is this? This is very cool. And the people was always with a smile, even when there were bad moments on the event, I don&#8217;t know, because something broke, or something like that, or people running because they arrived late for, I don&#8217;t know, always with a smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was one thing that caught me the attention because I thought I was, I&#8217;m not going to start a conversation with anyone. I feel like I could have done that, and that people that was on a small groups, if I started and go to any group, the group will open and take me into that group. And that was one thing that WordCamp Bilbao showed me about, you have to try to be more open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also it is one thing that WordPress is showing me, that I have to be more open and more, I don&#8217;t know how to say it, more helpful with each other, yeah. If someone comes here for talking with me, it&#8217;s like, oh yeah, probably I interest him or she to talk with me about, I don&#8217;t know, WordPress, my life or, I don&#8217;t know, anything, or his life. Here at WordCamp Turin I have met, I don&#8217;t know how many people, but nowadays we have NFC tags that gives you the contact details of the people, and that is awesome because if I don&#8217;t feel like I want to interact with anyone, I say, I don&#8217;t have social energy, but here you have my contact, here you have my Instagram account, my X account. X account, that sounds very bad, my Twitter account please. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s like, we could talk tomorrow, or I don&#8217;t know, who knows? In the next WordCamp we could meet up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think one of the nice things about these events, that you learn over time is that, quite a few people that you meet at one event, will actually be at the next event. And there&#8217;s also a different philosophy. So if you go to an event, let&#8217;s say, oh, I don&#8217;t know, a networking event that&#8217;s got nothing to do with WordPress, that&#8217;s in a for-profit industry, everybody&#8217;s there for the reason of selling you something, or promoting something, and the whole setup feels different. Whereas at these WordCamps, most people who are wearing the T-shirts saying that they&#8217;re organising the event, are volunteers, they&#8217;re giving up their time for free. And it&#8217;s for the greater good of this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often talk about this, but I still can&#8217;t work it out. I don&#8217;t know what it is about this community, but it seems to attract a whole bunch of nice people. And I think that&#8217;s one of the things, when I first attended a WordCamp, I immediately got that feeling. Just, wow, like you said, there&#8217;s smiling faces and, you know, if you wander near them, they open up, and what have you. And I just got the feeling, like a much more friendly feeling, and it stuck with me. So my first event was a WordCamp in London, and it left me with the impression, I want to do that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have that? I imagine it wasn&#8217;t perfect. There are probably things where you thought, oh, that was a bit, you know, I wish that would&#8217;ve gone better, or maybe you didn&#8217;t attend everything that you wished to, whatever it may be. But at the end of that, did you come away thinking, right, this is my clan, this is my group, I&#8217;m going to go to more of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Yeah, I feel that. After WordCamp Bilbao, I feel like, yeah, I want more of this. The next day of the contributor day, I signed up for WordCamp Irun 2019, that was next month if I don&#8217;t remember. And I was like, woah, WordCamp Irun 2019, that also was a very special WordCamp because was a WordCamp where they invented, I think, a new format for the WordCamps, that was called WordPress on the Street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was, one day, the Friday. They put it on, place to talk on the street, on the very big street of Irun. And there was people talking there about WordPress, and there was people on the bars that were in that place looking and saying, I don&#8217;t know what is WordPress, but I am enjoying of this. And there was people of the community that I didn&#8217;t know at that time. But I remember that Joan Boluda, who is very known on this WordPress world, was talking on the street for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One guy that sells courses online was talking about, I don&#8217;t remember what, on the street. It is a format that hasn&#8217;t been done again on Irun, and I think that could be done again, because that attracted a lot of people of Irun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ve never heard of that, and I think that&#8217;s such a neat idea. If you get the location just right, and I guess you&#8217;ve got to have it near the venue, or what have you, and there are people passing by. Yeah, that&#8217;s really fascinating. I genuinely haven&#8217;t heard of that before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the bits that you found yourself being drawn towards in the community? You obviously showed up at that event, and you didn&#8217;t know which bits, well, you probably didn&#8217;t even know what tables there were going to be. After that, where have you found yourself being drawn to? Is there a bit of the community that you enjoy more, I don&#8217;t know, security, core, or whatever?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:49] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> I always have enjoyed polyglots team. I am also currently a GT of the Basque locale. So I submit and I approve the changes on the Basque locale translations. Since then, every WordCamp, I have been on the Polyglots table. In Bilbao, I manage myself in Bilbao, this year, I managed myself the Polyglot&#8217;s table. And we recruited new translators for Basque. Because Basque is a locale that is a little bit, not very translated. Needs a very big push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the thing is that, not too much people know Basque. In Spain, if you don&#8217;t do that in Bilbao, in the Basque country, you will never get someone that will translate to Basque. And I&#8217;ve been on the Core table for my first time, and that was a very good experience because I sent a pull request for Gutenberg, for making the interactivity API from JavaScript to TypeScript, for making the types, and type checking, and all sort of things to prepare it for the 6.6 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you said that, since Bilbao, you&#8217;ve been to more or less all the local WordCamps. You haven&#8217;t missed anything. I guess what I&#8217;m trying to tease out of this episode, and we&#8217;re getting to that point now is, has it changed your life? Do you feel that, because it&#8217;s so difficult to imagine, when we say WordPress, it&#8217;s software. You download it from the internet, and you put it on a server, and you have a website of some kind. But it isn&#8217;t that, it&#8217;s much more than that. It&#8217;s this community, it&#8217;s a philosophy, it&#8217;s events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How profound has it been? If you were to trace it back to that moment at Bilbao, can you honestly say that it is WordPress, and all that means, that has transformed things. And, has it made your life better? Have you got new friendships, and a better quality of life because of those friendships and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Yeah. If I hadn&#8217;t go to WordCamp Bilbao, I wouldn&#8217;t be here probably. And also, probably, I wouldn&#8217;t have work at the place that I was working until a few months. And I wouldn&#8217;t met a lot of people that is very good people. All people in the Spanish communities is very good people. I love them so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;ve made real friendships. Because you can make a lot of acquaintances in the WordPress space. People that you know, you know their face. You can say hi to them, but you might not, I don&#8217;t know, go out for a meal with them or something like that, and really class them as friends. But you&#8217;ve managed to make those relationships real friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Yeah, I made very strong relationships. For instance, with Paco Marchante, who is from the plugins team, with his girlfriend Paula Carmona. We have a group, and we talk every day. They are like my reference in friends, and I have made a very strong friendship relationship with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned some of the things that you have to deal with. Do you find that the way that you can communicate with your friends in WordPress, because often a lot of it&#8217;ll be, I don&#8217;t know, Slack channels or something like that, does that work better for you? So it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re always going to be, I don&#8217;t know, meeting up in a bar, or going to a live event. A lot of it will take place on text-based things, where you can do that in the comfort of your own home. Does that aspect of it make it easier for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:18] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Yeah, a lot. A lot because it&#8217;s like, today I don&#8217;t want to socialise, so I don&#8217;t look my phone, and everything perfect. Instead, if we meet on a bar, it&#8217;s like, no guys, I won&#8217;t be going today, sorry. And it&#8217;s like more for that. I don&#8217;t meet up at the bar for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress, the Slack channels are like my newsletter for all days. I try to maintain myself reading every day the Making WordPress Core Slack channel, because it&#8217;s like newsletter of WordPress, using new PRs, using new features, new bugs. Someone says one day, today is hunting day, so we are going to meet up here to review, I don&#8217;t know, review issues. Sometimes it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t going to text because I am a little bit shy, but I am going to read you, and I am going to follow you, and probably someday I will say something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I mean, it really does feel like, the way that people communicate in the WordPress community, I mean, obviously there are events like this, where you can meet up people face-to-face and what have you. But it does lend itself really well to, you can do it whilst you&#8217;re in the comfort of your own home, you can be sitting eating breakfast and having these conversations. You can have your laptop, watching the telly at the same time. You can really make the environment that you&#8217;re in really comfortable, and exactly what you want, and be socialising at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, everything that you&#8217;ve said, we&#8217;re at the biggest WordCamp there is. It&#8217;s about 3000 people. It&#8217;s really big. And you&#8217;ve laid out this story, and yet you&#8217;re going to be given a presentation here. And first of all, how are you feeling about that? Are you feeling okay about that? Let&#8217;s just leave it like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> When I arrived the first day here, that was on the contributor day, and I saw the track one, that is the place where I am going to talk, that was like, oh, yeah, it was that big. Here fit probably 2000 people, and was like, woah. And on contributor day, when I was on the photography team as a volunteer, I went up on the stage to do some photos, to do the family photo. And I&#8217;ve seen all people there, I was like, oh, I want to go now to a local store, buy some Apple Vision Pro glasses, or something like that, that is very new. And they announce like, you won&#8217;t see anything from outside, put some images from the Alps or something like that, and start doing my slides. Because that is like, woah, I don&#8217;t know how I am going to feel tomorrow to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hope it goes well. I mean, I really do. From everything that you&#8217;ve told me, it seems like you&#8217;ve come on a really profoundly life-changing journey. Honestly, it is very, very rare that I talk to somebody, and I talk to a lot of people, whose actual life has been kind of turned upside down in a good way by the software, and the community around the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not we&#8217;re talking about plugins, or themes, or code, or what have you. It&#8217;s deeply affecting me this story, I think it&#8217;s really amazing. And it sounds like it&#8217;s allowing you to do a lot of things that you wish to do. The community supporting you, helping you, and I hope that it goes well tomorrow. I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;ll be fine because you know that, despite the fact that there might be large numbers of people in the audience, all of those people are, it sounds a bit corny, but all of those people are nice people, and they&#8217;re wishing you the best. So I really hope it goes well tomorrow. And I&#8217;d just like to say thank you for sharing your story. That was really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] <strong>Eneko Garrido:</strong> Thank you for you for this opportunity for me talking here, because this was like, oh, someone wants for me to talk on a podcast. I received an Slack message, and I was like, woah, what is this? I am dreaming or something like that. This only happens to the big talkers, to the biggest speakers of WordCamps. Thank you for you, for this opportunity to be here today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are very, very, welcome. Thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today. Really appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Eneko Garrido.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eneko is a full-stack developer who has made significant contributions to the WordPress community since attending his first WordCamp in 2019. Eneko&#8217;s journey with WordPress began when he attended WordCamp Bilbao during a challenging time in his life, marked by anxiety and depression. This pivotal experience not only transformed his career but also enriched his personal life, leading him to become a passionate contributor and advocate for the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off by discussing Eneko&#8217;s initial encounter with WordCamp Bilbao, where he felt a profound sense of belonging and support from the vibrant WordPress community. Despite his initial hesitations, Eneko was drawn to the inclusive and welcoming environment, which motivated him to participate more actively in future WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eneko goes on to share how his role as a polyglot contributor for the Basque locale has been a consistent source of joy and purpose. His commitment to translating WordPress into Basque has not only helped the community, but also deepened his connection to his cultural heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the impact that WordPress has had on Eneko&#8217;s life, from opening new career opportunities, to fostering lasting friendships. Eneko credits the WordPress community with providing him with a supportive network that has helped him navigate various challenges, including his autism diagnosis in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we discuss Eneko&#8217;s preparations for delivering a talk at WordCamp Europe, a testament to his growth and confidence since his first WordCamp experience. Despite the daunting prospect of speaking to a large audience, Eneko remains resolute and grateful for the supportive community that has been instrumental in his journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in hearing a heartfelt story about the life-changing potential of the WordPress community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eneko&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp Europe 2024: <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/how-the-wordpress-community-changed-my-life/\">How the WordPress community changed my life</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-diversity-fund/\">Yoast diversity fund</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renfe.com/es/en/renfe-group/renfe-group\">Renfe Group</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bilbao.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Bilbao</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/128-fernando-tellado-on-ai-tools-and-rehumanising-the-web\">Fernando Tellado&#8217;s Jukebox podcast epsiode about AI Tools and Rehumanising the Web</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://irun.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp Irun</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: The Buyer’s View, Scaling Enterprise with Karim Marucchi and Tom Willmot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84784\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-buyers-view-scaling-enterprise-with-karim-marucchi-and-tom-willmot/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34401:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-58 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-57 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-13 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-56 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-25 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-55 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1650\" height=\"1650\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/avalara-logo-_dtw.png?resize=1650%2C1650&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-75400\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-26\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/enterprise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Avalara</a></strong>:  providing cloud-based and scalable global tax compliance that is hassle-free, safe and secure plus topped off with enterprise-class security.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nEpisode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Karim:<br />Well, hello, welcome to Scaling Enterprise WordPress and Open Source Software. This is the Buyer’s View. As you might remember from our last episode, we are going to be doing two podcasts a month: one that is closer to the buyer’s view and helps the enterprise see how to engage and work with WordPress and open source software, and the other side will be more of a community-focused WordPress project podcast around how the project and WordPress can focus on the enterprise in certain areas. My name is Karim from the Scale Consortium. I&#8217;m also CEO of Crowd Favorite. With me is Tom Willmot. Tom?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Hello. Great to be here. Excited to be kicking this off, what I hope becomes a regular thing for us. I&#8217;m also a founding member of the Scale Consortium and the CEO and co-founder of Human Made. Yeah, excited to get into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Me too. Me too. So let&#8217;s jump right in. We at the Scale Consortium figured that it was time to have a group that unified and had a singular voice around helping the enterprise navigate open source software and WordPress specifically and its options. Tom, how do you see how we do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean, good to probably just step back and talk about that a little bit. The challenge we have in the enterprise WordPress space, and I think the challenge buyers face is compared to the single vendor options that are out there where they can talk to the buyer with a unified message and simplified positioning. The strength of the WordPress ecosystem is it&#8217;s really broad and deep and that brings lots of benefits. There&#8217;s lots of choice and flexibility, but it does mean that as a buyer you can look at all of that and it can be a bit overwhelming. It can be a bit confusing. Where do you go? At Scale Consortium, we come together and we work together across vendors within the space to give that clear view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Well, one of the things I hear most is if an enterprise wants to approach WordPress, where do they go? Do they go to a host?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Right? Who&#8217;s the vendor? Maybe they turn up to a host, maybe they find an agency. But yeah, it&#8217;s not so simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />And then on the community side, folks argue that if you go to one vendor or one host, you&#8217;re going to get their flavor of WordPress. One of the things that I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;re going to dive into is that really you can customize WordPress to do almost anything, but the point here is that there are no flavors of WordPress. There are flavors of Linux that are forks. This is all the same WordPress, right? It&#8217;s just the special sauce that any one team might bring to it or the special sauce that any one host or any other one product might bring to it. But WordPress is not the same type of complex ecosystem that operating systems were for the last 40 years. So let&#8217;s dive right into the introduction to why WordPress. Its current market share is 43% of the internet. So it has very strong strengths, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yes. Even amongst the kind of enterprise tier, it&#8217;s pretty dominant depending on how you&#8217;re talking about measuring it. It’s certainly true that the vast majority of enterprises, the vast majority of businesses, have got WordPress somewhere, even if they&#8217;re not using it as their primary CMS, they&#8217;re using WordPress somewhere in their organization. And actually there&#8217;s plenty that are using it as their primary, but I think that&#8217;s secondary. The CMS kind of narrative is the WordPress history is quite relevant, I suppose, to how WordPress started to break into business and how that&#8217;s evolved over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />But if it’s a generalist platform and it’s being used as that secondary system, is it just vanilla is the problem we run into all the time? We have a hard time explaining to folks that what ends up happening is this isn’t just a generalist system that can’t help you with your specific need because the WordPress project is so general, you can actually bring it and customize it for your specific needs without having to use the technical term fork, without having to fork the code, without having to move away from it. You can adapt it to your needs. It’s so adaptable, which is what I think some of the successes out there are, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Sure, yeah, a hundred percent. That means that the barrier to entry actually is quite low. It’s quite easy to get going with WordPress and then you can customize it and it’ll flex with you and scale with you. There’s WordPress out of the box. Of course, if you’re an enterprise user of WordPress, you do need some stuff on top of that, right? You have specific common needs across enterprise or workflows or governance or digital asset management or whatnot. And so there’s this layer of stuff that exists in the ecosystem that does make WordPress meet the needs of enterprise. And then of course you get the vertical-specific needs too, whether that’s higher education, financial institutions, or publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />But I want to jump into this question of the first choice versus second choice, because I remember the way I approached WordPress when we first came into the space was automatically assuming it was going to be a first choice. One of our larger projects that we started now 14 years ago, it was the first choice. So I came to the WordPress larger enterprise community thinking, oh, let&#8217;s do that. And then I was shocked to find out that more than one of the managed hosts, their marketing was all targeted towards WordPress as a secondary enterprise. They had one of those monolithic enterprise systems as their .com, and then the host was saying, we&#8217;re never going to get that .com, so we&#8217;re actually going to market as put your .com out there with this monolithic system and then after that, or proprietary system. And then after that, all these smaller sites that you don&#8217;t want to invest so much time in those ones can actually be on WordPress. And that shocked me. I mean, how did you find that back then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean, I think to some degree that reflects how WordPress usually comes to be used by an organization, which is usually bottom up. It&#8217;s usually people in the organization who are on the front lines using these tools and they want to use WordPress. Maybe they&#8217;re familiar with it, maybe they&#8217;ve used it somewhere else, and then they&#8217;ll fight internally to get WordPress. And so maybe it comes into one specific team or one department rather than those large rollouts, which are usually top down run by IT or something. I think what we&#8217;ve seen over the last decade, it started out like that actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there are plenty of organizations where that the WordPress gets its foot in the door and then it works its way through the organization and unseats the primary CMS. And so I think that’s great. WordPress is definitely validated as a great primary option. And if anything, I think that’s the biggest gap now to close because we are, how do we make the jump from people inside organizations fighting the fight to get WordPress? How do we make that jump to the top down the IT rollouts or digital strategy rollouts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />And that’s interesting because I’ve always tried to address it specifically as how do we head to head compare ourselves to these monolithic proprietary systems and how do we show that we can feature for feature or more importantly business need by business need actually come up to that level? Because people still think of WordPress as this, oh, it’s just a CMS. Oh, it’s just to push pages and articles not necessarily can help me integrate data from many different sources or so forth or so on. So it’s interesting to see that there’s part of the market that is still thinking of it this way as second choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there’s the other part of the market that’s saying, how do we actually show that we can do this? And more and more case studies are coming up that way. You’ve worked on a giant major European bank as WordPress being the first open source. We’ve worked on one of the largest media companies with WordPress being the first choice, the .com, so to speak, of all their major sites. So it works that way. But how do we get that message out? And I guess that falls down to the enterprise needs. What do you think about that? What are the enterprise needs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I think that’s the opportunity here, right? Because actually the enterprise needs, I think particularly these days, the trends that we’re seeing in the industry actually I think pair very well with WordPress around total cost of ownership, the need for a lot of flexibility that just increases and increases. We’ve seen this kind of trend of all-in-one DXP, which feels like it’s peaked and now, and actually we want to own more of our stack and be able to swap pieces out, and we need it to integrate with the long tail of things that we are using across the enterprise. And so actually that really starts to, WordPress actually been a particularly good fit for a lot of those needs. And again, it’s like we’ve got to form clear messaging around that so that enterprises are aware and they&#8217;re being told that they can discover that for themselves. It doesn’t need to come up through this backdoor, secondary route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So the general WordPress project as an open source project needs to stay communicating that we can be all things to all people. And because most of the internet are smaller sites in the enterprise space, we&#8217;re a very small subset of clients by volume. What ends up happening is it’s a very small voice. So then it becomes up to the Scale Consortium podcasts like this one, the agencies, and products that want to work with the enterprise to try and communicate that. What we need to do is try to bring together some</p>\n\n\n\n<p>sort of unified messaging because those needs aren’t being met. If a particular host or product or an agency is saying, oh, well let me show you how I do it in this one exact example, they get pigeonholed right away. Most people are very surprised to find out that WordPress can be used as the central hub of an ERP system. There are large medium enterprises, not necessarily the Fortune 100, but right below that, that are using WordPress to manage content on what could be classified as an ERP system, not just a CMS or a marketing solution. You’d say, why would you do that? Why wouldn’t you use one of those other applications? And I feel that the bottom line of the need of the enterprise is not what is the name of the package, what is the technology? What programming language am I going to use? What’s going to solve the business need? And in this particular case, going back to quoting Matt Mullenweg from WordCamp San Francisco, 2010 or 2012, it takes five minutes to learn how to publish a page. Bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />That time to publish and the flexibility of that, again, it is something actually we can often take for granted. I think within the community, we often have this experience when we are demoing to clients and actually it&#8217;s the stuff that we forget is actually quite groundbreaking already. The fact that you can log in and edit a page and publish it, have it live within five, 10 minutes, and those things are not actually true across the rest of the competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Exactly, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah. This kind of central hub piece, I wonder if that&#8217;s something we certainly see a lot. I imagine it’s similar in the work you are doing where actually customers are building DXPs, they do end up with a DXP, but they&#8217;ve put it together themselves with WordPress at the center and all of these other pieces. And so it&#8217;s true that the world has the needs of enterprise that have evolved beyond just CMS. Absolutely. There&#8217;s a bunch of other pieces now, but WordPress doesn&#8217;t need to be all those things. What WordPress needs to do is integrate really well with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />That&#8217;s the key. That’s the key, right? Because both of us have done presentations on how you&#8217;ve built a DXP centered on WordPress and it&#8217;s an amazing product, and we&#8217;ve done this composable direction, which we&#8217;re going to talk about a little bit later, but this composable direction. But the key is integrating. The key is for all these folks, all the folks who might be listening who have been around the block a few times, old school, 1990s, system integration of middleware. If you think of it in those terms, WordPress is a great connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah. That&#8217;s usually where we find clients end up in actually. They&#8217;ve got WordPress as that central hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So how do you address when you end up going to an enterprise client and you have the technical team of the enterprise, the client goes, but it’s WordPress, it’s a blog. How do you address that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I think that is something that&#8217;s improved quite a lot, certainly over the last five years. I think the number one thing is just that the WordPress, there are so many examples now of WordPress being used really for the very biggest stuff on the internet across almost all verticals. And so you can usually rely on just a lot of direct evidence. Actually, that’s not the case. So usually it&#8217;s a mix of lots of case studies, lots of references, and lots of demos that you can show and demonstrate. And perhaps five or 10 years ago, you perhaps were on the cutting edge if you were trying to use work with the scale. Actually that’s just completely normal now. And the concern is just out of date. And so you can just show all of the evidence. And actually there are many more examples. There are many more high scale WordPress sites than most of these other platforms actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />No, exactly. Exactly. So I think we&#8217;ve reached the part where it&#8217;s time for a small break and when we come back, Tom, I think you&#8217;re going to head us off with talking about the evolution of content management and how we got here. See everybody in a minute. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Okay, welcome back. So Karim, we touched a little bit in that previous section on the evolution of the enterprise CMS and the evolution of content management and how WordPress fits into them. And so I think that’d be good to just dive in on a bit and expand on. One of the things I often reflect on is that the narratives out in the industry, the buzzwords, the framing, the structure of how we think about enterprise CMS has actually historically mostly been set by the competitors to WordPress. So I think this is an opportunity, right, for WordPress to start actually putting its vision for enterprise CMS forward and more that maybe you can do as a bit of an explainer on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Well, yeah, because if you look at the history, content management systems started out what we used to call OnPrem, right, on premises. And then with the evolution of SaaS and the evolution of not just software as a service, but just thinking of things being not within your own system but putting together lots of other systems. You ended up with just this expectation that it was out there in somebody else&#8217;s system. But there’s a lot of Fortune customers and there’s a lot of mid-market enterprise companies that say, we need our data internally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing that’s vastly overlooked is that if you&#8217;re using open source and specifically WordPress as this hub that we were talking about, that lets you literally own your data and actually keep solid control over what&#8217;s being shared outside. It&#8217;s not about points of failure necessarily, although it can be. It&#8217;s not about having things across 12 or 15 different SaaS’s out there and different companies having access to your data. You solve all of those things if you are centralizing saying that your source of truth is your content management system. And that is an evolutionary piece that&#8217;s been lost in the last 10 years of the MarTech stack explosion of SaaS products, I feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I couldn&#8217;t agree more. A common occurrence for us, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll run into too, it will be working with a new client who are wanting to move to WordPress and a driver of that move is that they have bought into a legacy CMS or a CMS that is now legacy in which the company behind it actually are no longer around or they&#8217;re no longer supporting it. Maybe they&#8217;ve built a new product and the cost to move to that new product is the same as the cost to move to WordPress. Actually, that’s a pretty dominant frame for the industry. A lot of enterprises make the decisions over a five to 10-year cycle because actually that&#8217;s the cycle. That&#8217;s the lifetime of a lot of these platforms that in five to 10 years they&#8217;re going to be legacy and you&#8217;re going to want to move to something new. A lot of the education we are doing as part of a WordPress installation is that&#8217;s actually not true in open source. We&#8217;ve got a much longer time horizon ahead and you&#8217;re not going to need to move off in five years because WordPress is still going to be around and innovating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />I&#8217;m actually going to challenge that, Tom. I&#8217;m going to say I don&#8217;t see clients that are spending in a total of five years on a platform before saying they want to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Like you&#8217;re seeing it come down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />I&#8217;m seeing it come down because of their marketing so hard against each other. Sure. If you look at the market leaders in the DXP area, they&#8217;re marketing so hard against each other that they&#8217;re innovative and the others aren’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />It&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />They&#8217;re marketing so hard against each other about how they&#8217;re better that CMOs and CIOs are saying, well, maybe it&#8217;s worth the cost of migration and they&#8217;re bouncing. Or if it is a longer-term thing, it&#8217;s because they created a bespoke dead end of their own that the cost of owning it is so high that they&#8217;re like, okay, now what do we do? And coming back to your point, doing something with a platform like WordPress that doesn&#8217;t have major migrations,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />No, sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />It’s not free. You actually need to maintain it, right? Which is another misconception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean it’s actually a big difference even between WordPress and Drupal, which are the two open source platforms, but Drupal actually does have this cadence of major backwards compatibility breaking releases, which we see from the WordPress side whereas a user of Drupal seven, you&#8217;ve got to make the decision, okay, I&#8217;m going to spend a bunch of money moving to Drupal 10, or actually maybe I&#8217;ll move to something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />And another nod to Matt and the way he&#8217;s thought of the WordPress project, Matt Mullenweg, in the sense that he has been really steadfast about not breaking backwards compatibility sometimes even to the point where you and I are frustrated in thinking how can we move the platform forward? But it&#8217;s really helped us in that long-term future. So as I&#8217;ve seen the SaaS companies market harder and clients have more and more choices and flip even more, the more I&#8217;ve seen the total cost of ownership come down for staying on something like WordPress, the more I&#8217;ve seen the cost of migration be not just money, but also the time aspect and the retraining of your employee base. So it&#8217;s been very hard to understand exactly how to relate this back to customers because they&#8217;ve only seen the last 10 years of marketing that again, these marketing budgets on these major platforms are huge and all these individual companies that are trying to help enterprises with WordPress are going, we can&#8217;t match that marketing of that major platform. That brings me to the one word that I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>think has started to take over from just digital experience or digital transformation. There&#8217;s a lot around the word composable these days, and I know a lot of people assume that means, oh, I&#8217;m just going to compose three or four SaaS platforms, I&#8217;m going to compose my own system. We&#8217;ve come to realize that when they do that, they end up with a mess of the poor marketing staff that has 18 tabs open in a browser and to get one workflow done for marketing tasks, they&#8217;ve got quite literally six to seven different interfaces with six to seven different products that are trying to swap information back into each other, sometimes in real-time, sometimes not. Is there a way that this general tool of WordPress helps? We feel it does. How does your team deal with that with the vertical of the enterprise? How does your team try to address how can we not have customers do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I think we went through this phase with the kind of all-in-ones, whereas kind of this bundling phase and the dream there that was being sold was if everything&#8217;s all in one place, you&#8217;re not going to have to worry about it. You&#8217;ll get everything you ever need here. And usually that doesn&#8217;t work out right, because actually they&#8217;re too limiting and the stuff you need to do, they can&#8217;t innovate fast enough to keep up with the pace of change in the ecosystem. As then we&#8217;ve kind of swung the other way, okay, now it&#8217;s completely composable all of your tools just talk to each other. You can swap any of them out at any time. But again, that brings a bunch of challenges, right? Actually it ends up with a pretty brittle system. How do you do governance across 20, 30 different SaaS tools that you lose track of what you are being billed for? The person who set that SaaS tool up is left now and you can no longer log in. A bunch of challenges there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you go through those cycles and you come back to meet a little bit in the middle where actually this hybrid CMS that sits at the center that absolutely can plug in to the stuff you want to use externally but is still providing a significant portion of your functionality and acts as that hub. The compromise between composability and all-in-one, I think the fully composable platforms inevitably will need to trend in that direction where actually there ends up being some hub or the management platform that ends up needing to be developed to just manage all those different SaaS tools becomes that hub over time probably. And same thing, we&#8217;re seeing the all-in-one DXPs trying to become as composable as possible as quickly as possible because realizing the limitations of all-in-one, and again, I think it’s that trend just plays really nicely for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />But can an all-in-one solution be the best tool for every job?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />No, I think that’s the fundamental failure. Ultimately, they’re attractive to begin with and I think we’ve just seen that play out in the market where the pitch is very attractive and very compelling, and then the reality doesn’t deliver on that for a variety of reasons. And I think we just, we&#8217;ve seen that play out in the market. We&#8217;re past the peak of that. There are now plenty of organizations who&#8217;ve bought into that and either they&#8217;ve been paying for a bunch of tools they haven’t really got the value from, or they need to do stuff more quickly than the platform that they’re bought into is innovating and they&#8217;re starting to look around and want to use other stuff. And the bunch of those end up moving to something like WordPress. That’s part of the inflow we see into the WordPress market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Absolutely. Exactly. Well, so I feel like episode zero, our first episode with Brad gave us the concept of what the entire show&#8217;s about, and today we&#8217;ve laid out what the differences are between the two different shows and introduced the concepts of what we&#8217;re going to talk about. And with that, we agree completely as you were saying in talking to our friend Remkus from this community. I&#8217;m sure that the upcoming episodes where we&#8217;re going to talk about procurement, we&#8217;re going to have to talk about how to approach customers, we&#8217;re going to talk about how to service those customers. We&#8217;re going to talk about what the solutions are for the enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s going to be a little bit more of showing how we have a little bit of a different take on these things. But just from this conversation, I can see conversations around, like I said, speaking with a procurement specialist, speaking quite literally with somebody from some of these other monolithic platforms about what they feel they do best and having these conversations, talking about how to integrate well with SaaS and what that looks like, customized workflows. These are some of the topics that I feel like are coming down the pipeline in our next episodes that are really going to start asking and answering questions on how can we do better as a WordPress community in communicating this and give some information out to enterprise buyers on how they can approach any of the vendors who work with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />It’s a nerdy thing to say, but I think it&#8217;s a pretty exciting time in the enterprise CMS space, right? There is actually a lot happening. There are some trends peaking. There are some new trends coming. There&#8217;s a lot of players in the space scrambling to figure out what that is. The analysts have all got their takes. Are we agile CMS? Are we composable? Is it composable content? There&#8217;s so many of these things. As a buyer, it’s pretty confusing. And a lot of these platforms at the moment you’re kind of like, okay, I&#8217;m going math, I&#8217;m all in on this, or I&#8217;m going with an all-in-one. And you&#8217;re kind of all in on that. So they&#8217;re pretty consequential decisions as well, I think, as a buyer. And so I think there’s a ton of scope for us to get into all of that debate, all of that. What&#8217;s the WordPress answer to a lot of these things? Again, that&#8217;s not really discussed much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />I’d like to invite literally an analyst from one of the companies to come on and ask them why, besides the fact that it&#8217;s pay for play, why can&#8217;t we get any attention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I think that would be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />As an open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I would love to do an episode on analysts and their place. I think there&#8217;s tons to say there. Yeah, well exciting stuff. Okay, good first episode and more to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Absolutely. So Tom, tell us about Scaling Enterprise WordPress and Open Source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />We are the buyer’s view, but we&#8217;ll be in the same feed as the sister cast that we&#8217;re going to be doing with Brad Williams, which is, as Karim said, the Enterprise WordPress community-focused version. And so we&#8217;ll be in the same feed. So you can listen to both of those. I think both are going to be interesting to everyone inside enterprise WordPress. If you’re a buyer, maybe you’re more interested in this buyer&#8217;s view one, add us to your favorite podcast subscription. Come along on this journey. And I think most of all, we are just starting out and so we really want to hear from people. What are you seeing out in the space? What are the questions people have got? What would they hope to get from a show like this? I think we&#8217;ll lead a lot on that as well as we go. Do people have questions that we can answer? Are there topics people would like us to cover? Are there people that it would be great to get on? Let us know and we&#8217;ll endeavor to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So go over to Do the Woo and check on our feeds and whichever podcast platform you&#8217;re using, and also feel free to go to scalecms.org and get in touch with us and ask us to do a particular topic or dive into something. We&#8217;d be happy to talk to you. We are really looking forward to bringing back some informative and useful information to help enterprises really understand how to better engage with WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Alright, a good place to finish. Thanks very much, Karim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Thank you Tom, it’s been awesome. Talk to you soon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <em><strong>Scaling Enterprise WordPress and Open Source Software</strong>,</em> hosts <strong>Karim Marucchi</strong> and <strong>Tom Willmot</strong> kick off <strong><em>The Buyer&#8217;s View.</em></strong> They discuss the challenges and benefits of using WordPress and open source software in the enterprise space and highlight the flexibility and adaptability of WordPress, which can be customized to meet specific needs without having to fork the code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talk move into the evolution of content management and how WordPress can serve as a central hub in a digital experience platform (DXP), integrating with other tools and systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dual Podcast Approach</strong>: Do the Woo in partnership with the Scale Consortium is producing two podcasts a month: one focusing on the buyer&#8217;s perspective and the other on the community-focused WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unifying Enterprise and Open Source</strong>: The Scale Consortium aims to provide a unified voice to help enterprises navigate open source software and WordPress, offering guidance on engagement and options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enterprise Challenges</strong>: Enterprises face challenges with WordPress due to its broad and deep ecosystem, which can be overwhelming and confusing compared to single vendor options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customization and Flexibility</strong>: WordPress can be highly customized without forking the code, making it adaptable for specific enterprise needs and serving as a versatile tool for various applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primary vs. Secondary CMS</strong>: There is a perception issue where WordPress is often seen as a secondary choice, but there are many examples of it being used as the primary CMS in major enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enterprise Needs Alignment</strong>: WordPress aligns well with current enterprise trends such as total cost of ownership, flexibility, and the need for integration with various tools and systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Composability Trend</strong>: The concept of composability is becoming more prevalent, and WordPress serves well as a central hub for integrating various SaaS platforms and tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Integration Capabilities</strong>: WordPress excels as a connector in a composable ecosystem, allowing for seamless integration with other systems and tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong>: WordPress has a strong focus on backward compatibility, reducing the need for major migrations and ensuring long-term stability for enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marketing Challenges</strong>: The marketing budgets of major platforms overshadow the smaller voices advocating for WordPress, making it challenging to communicate its advantages effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Analyst Engagement</strong>: There is a desire to engage analysts and better understand why open source platforms like WordPress struggle to get the same level of attention as proprietary systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future Episodes</strong>: Future podcast episodes will cover topics such as procurement, customer approaches, service strategies, integration with SaaS, and customized workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: The podcast invites listeners to provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest topics to ensure the content is relevant and valuable for enterprise buyers and the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 09:00:00

The other day I was thinking about the three Cs: community, commenting, and coding. Okay, I lied. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about coding at all. Coding, I don&#8217;t think about it much. It&#8217;s never in my face. I know it&#8217;s there. I know people do great stuff with it. I hear people talk about it. So the only reason I put that in there is it just sounded better. I really wanted to talk about community, commenting, and blogging, but it just didn&#8217;t sound as good. But that is what has been on my mind lately. Well, actually I lied again because that wasn&#8217;t on my mind lately. It&#8217;s always on my mind. That&#8217;s all I think about is this stuff. So I got to quit lying about things and just get to the point here that it&#8217;s really something I am thinking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, a lot, those three things. And as a result, I got into some conversations. I had a conversation actually with Bryce from Metorik. I don&#8217;t know if any of you know him, but he was on the podcast lately. We were talking about community, the builder community where they can connect and talk. We threw a few ideas around. Then it moved into another whole thing because of some stuff going on. And of course, I had to have a conversation with Ronald, one of our hosts here, Ronald Gijsel, and we always have great conversations and we started talking about this stuff and we thought, why don&#8217;t we just take it live and talk about it? So, I twisted Ronald&#8217;s arm and he&#8217;s popping back in to actually, he called it, what did you call this? Do you remember what you called this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Different ideas. I think my latest is almost like unpacking blogging with Bob or was there another reference to that? It&#8217;ll come to me. But yeah, I&#8217;m really excited actually just to discuss it live and ask you a few questions, what the goals are and bring it back to me and be very lengthy. And maybe at the end of this call, or this recording, we will come up with a final solution, a way you&#8217;ll have to give it direction and go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. Yeah. I was actually looking back, you called it a BlogStorm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />BlogStorm. Yeah. We were doing a brainstorm about everything around blogging. It&#8217;s a BlogStorm. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />So we&#8217;re just going to go for it here. And I hope Ronald said we&#8217;ll put some ideas together, thoughts, just what&#8217;s on our mind. I&#8217;ll set the stage. There was a point where I took the blog off because some part of my brain said, oh, I wanted to focus on audio and have everybody focus on the audio when they get there. And of course, I started to look at the site and thought it felt, I think I wrote this somewhere, it felt naked. It was like, where&#8217;s a blog? This is conversational. This is community. This is what it&#8217;s all about. So in turn, we&#8217;re working on bringing back the blog to Do the Woo, and that&#8217;s where this came because I had another idea. I had an idea about a newsletter and all this stuff kind of meshed together and Ronald deals with my crazy thinking and my train of thoughts and stuff. I brought up this newsletter idea and only because I keep hacking away at that thing. I&#8217;ve done that for so many years and never really progressed. What are your thoughts? I mean, you gave me some feedback. We won&#8217;t go into a lot of the details there, but just give me a thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah. The thought that came to mind is newsletters are great, but newsletters or anything, email notification of something that&#8217;s bigger. And so if you write a newsletter with long form, I dunno what is long form these days, but something that gives you everything in the newsletter, you don&#8217;t need to do anything other than read the newsletter. That&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re in the moment and in the moment of reading a particular topic, but also on a device that makes it pleasant to read it. And once it&#8217;s buried in your inbox, it&#8217;s kind of gone, difficult to get back and that moment when you send out hundreds of thousands of newsletters, what you see in the status within the first couple of minutes, you see a really high spike of the opening rate and then it sort of diminishes pretty quickly after that, even within the same 24 hours. Even if you have an intelligent system that sends the emails at the best time or thinks it&#8217;s the best time with the highest opening rate, I do always wonder what the engagement rate is. So in other words, you send a newsletter, you think I have a huge post, but how engaged are people who read your newsletter? If it&#8217;s a call to action to click through to something, that&#8217;s really easy, but maybe it&#8217;s like, oh, it&#8217;s an email from Bob. Okay, great. It&#8217;s quite long. I&#8217;m doing something else. I&#8217;m switching between 15 different tabs and different windows and other things are happening at the same time. Are you really absorbing the content and engaging it? It&#8217;s really difficult to do that. And so it&#8217;s great to have a notification, but maybe that notification should be, hey, there&#8217;s much more content in the blog and here&#8217;s your weekly reminder to explore and here are the things that have been happening, have been fed by our presenters and guests. And guess what? If you&#8217;re interested in coding, here&#8217;s a category, everything around coding, or here&#8217;s a category, everything around community and thought. And that got me thinking like, hey, how much content? We&#8217;re coming up to 500 podcasts now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, yeah. This will probably be, I&#8217;m not exactly sure the number, but we&#8217;re at around 500 in the 530 somethings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Oh, so we passed that. Yeah. Amazing. So apart from me, all the other super interesting guests, some of them I&#8217;ve interviewed as well in the past, they all have really interesting things to say that it would be great to have quotes, snippets, or even get them to write something on your blog. Anyway, that got me really quite excited about the opportunity and bringing back blogging, which is the core of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. And that&#8217;s what I mean. Like I said, I have Ronald there to smack me alongside the head. Every once in a while I get these little ideas and I&#8217;m doing them for maybe one specific reason or I&#8217;m thinking, how can I make this part better? And then I realize I have things inside there that are already bubbling on the site. One of the things you brought up, I&#8217;m going to flip back here, is you had brought up what Matt Mullenweg said and on his, I think he said it on his blog post about WordPress turning 21. And then I said it again in his talk at WordCamp Europe just a couple of months ago, and let&#8217;s say I pulled up the blog post and he gave 11 things that he&#8217;s just been thinking about. He says people should be thinking about one of them was blogging, commenting, and ping backs need to be fun. Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better. Almost every site would be improved by having a blog or a great blog. So when I looked at that, it was like I thought, man, back what, 2010 or so when I was blogging, that was kind of the heyday of blogging and everybody was commenting and it keeps nagging at me, this thing he said, and it&#8217;s not just what he said then, it was reaffirmation is what it was to me, what&#8217;s been on my mind when we started the new site, when we did the redesign to do the Woo. When we launched that in March and then officially at WordCamp Europe, we decided to open up comments again. And of course, that&#8217;s always a challenge. And I think there&#8217;s this thing inside of me that just, I won&#8217;t give up on it. Comments are there, there&#8217;s got to be something happening. So I&#8217;ve been publishing ping backs and stuff and some different things and it is true. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s so many ideas and thoughts going through my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah, I think you touched on something really important and that referencing to Matt, but it just occurred to me that WordPress is 21 years old and WordPress, not everybody started 21 years ago, but for 15 years we&#8217;ve had a number of new publishing platforms, mostly social media come, I mean they&#8217;re still here, they didn&#8217;t go away, but your audience might have moved to different platforms over time and definitely many, many, many more. And when you think of the next 15 years, are any of them still going to be there and relevant? But your blog will always be there. So you build up your diary, your journaling in a way over all those years and that&#8217;s owning that content as an asset is huge. So even if you don&#8217;t blog for the sake of SEO, it&#8217;s still within your own control that you can reuse on purpose and people can search for it and find different things. And I think that&#8217;s something that really, the longer we do this stuff, the more valuable it is that you really own that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, exactly. And for me, I think one of my challenges lately was my site BobWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />That was huge by the way, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. And we were talking about that because I had my initial thoughts were kind of going back and forth between the two. So I would repurpose some of the content on Do the Woo over at BobWP.com, and as much as I thought that was a good strategy, it didn&#8217;t really play out as I thought. And of course, Ronald, when we talked, he hinted maybe that content should be under Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Can you describe a little bit of your first thought of the content strategy when you were doing BobWP</p>\n\n\n\n<p>? What were you publishing and how was engagement? I know some of it was testing plugins and so on, and probably old versions that are totally irrelevant. That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s feasible anymore. But yeah, maybe you could share a little bit of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />So the whole thing with BobWP, what it&#8217;s always been, it&#8217;s always been a piece of something. And back in the day I would do tutorials and stuff, and that&#8217;s why a lot of this content no longer exists because it was really mostly about stuff that was at the time. And that stuff became outdated very quickly unless I went in and updated it, which I did. And when I actually separated the podcast that was originally started on BobWP, it was for that reason because I knew that I wanted to focus on Do the Woo. I wanted to build a brand more around that or build the buzz or get people directed to that. And so my strategy was always, I always had BobWP there and I did a little bit of blogging here and there, and then I came to the point where, like I said, I started thinking, well, should I start cross-promoting the two? Because a BobWP brand is known out there, which seemed like a good idea. My thought was that yeah, I could do a lot of back and forth because some people will go to BobWP and then I can send them over to Do the Woo, give them a snippet of that. Actually, it didn&#8217;t work as I strategically planned because there wasn&#8217;t as much traffic going to BobWP anymore because I let it mellow out, which was on purpose because I wanted my focus on Do the Woo. So that was how I kept looking at this and kept looking at this and I&#8217;ve actually made a decision going through all this. I&#8217;m at a point in life people can kind of say you&#8217;re at a certain age or you&#8217;re at a point in life where, okay, what&#8217;s going to be the next thing? Well, mine is really Do the Woo. It&#8217;s my focus. So I thought this is where I need to be all the time on Do the Woo because it&#8217;s always going to be, even the experiences I can share doing my own thing over however many years can always fit somewhere there. And as a result, I just recently made the decision to take down BobWP as a site and use my Gravatar profile, BobWP, basically as my website now for BobWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Your business card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And that was a long process and a lot of people have done that and I feel like that&#8217;s going to be the best thing I can now focus directly on Do the Woo. I moved some of the content back over from BobWP over on Do the Woo because it fits there and stuff. I just done some of the old posts and stuff. So that was that whole thinking through process. And in the middle of that we talked about it and stuff and we had, oh, I&#8217;m drawing a blank, Ronnie from Gravita and listening to him even occurred to me, this is such a great thing because it&#8217;s just I can send people where they want to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s like a massive signpost that&#8217;s attached to on top of your head, isn&#8217;t it? Are you business? You have a pleasure, are you sending money or are you just curious who I am? And then there you go. Just go wherever you need to go. Yeah, just one thing.<br />Nice. Do you question for you then is do you feel that BobWP might have served a different audience to where you are now with Woo? I know you&#8217;ve moved some of the content, so there&#8217;s a little bit of an overlap, but I wonder if there&#8217;s even a strategy where you say, Hey, there&#8217;s some probably personal stuff that might not always be suitable for the Woo audience and even if I write this one blog post per year, it doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s just there. So I have a space that can run it that can publish and that&#8217;s okay. And for everything else there is Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I thought about that and I want the BobWP brand now to be the gateway to Do the Woo. So that&#8217;s why I kept thinking when I looked at the site, it&#8217;s like I had people, you can go to do the Woo, you can see where I do this and all this stuff, but I felt like it was its own little piece there and honestly I started to realize that I was trying to force myself, it felt like the right move something in my gut and that&#8217;s kind of how I&#8217;ve always done things and maybe sometimes I regretted or something, but for now I just feel like because I basically have some content somewhere still on my WordPress dot com blog and I can always revive that sometime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah, it probably makes a great archive that even 10 years looks like I did that is a photo of me and whatever and then it&#8217;s still there. I think that becomes really a nice way your own tool of bringing back something that might be relevant even later, even if the minute on something. I also have another question then. When you think about the content for Do the Woo, how do you think about that? So do you want to write for your audience or how do you want them to engage and bring them in and get them to engage with to Do the Woo brand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />That is the fun part to think about, but the challenge I think for me, the site where I&#8217;ve moved my whole mindset is that blog becomes an arm of what Do the Woo stands for. And that is having hosts that have already shown interest come in and write guest posts and they can or having even a guest come in and do it. But as you and I talked about before and I think you alluded to a little bit is how that conversation can be carried from a audio podcast or somebody that talks about something in a podcast and says, I&#8217;m doing this five months later they do it. Do they want to come in and write a little bit about it</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Or what came out of it? What&#8217;s the outcome of that initial podcast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />It can tie in really easy and make this circle back and forth between the content and how to get people there and engaged. Aside from thinking of creating a forum or some membership or all the crazy stuff that&#8217;s available to us that I don&#8217;t even want to touch on It is it&#8217;s all through that commenting and how to get people, how to drive them there. And that&#8217;s through social, it&#8217;s different ways. There&#8217;s different things that I&#8217;ve discovered are Jetpack now that we&#8217;ve used that we&#8217;re using that for a lot of our stuff that there are things I want to test with that and try to drive people back to leaving comments and having conversation. There&#8217;s some stuff I even talked with somebody from Jetpack at WordCamp Europe and we can do a couple ideas back and forth and we&#8217;re continue that conversation. So I&#8217;m thinking of some different things. I&#8217;ve had a few other people suggest things or actually ask for things that this might be an interesting way to leave a comment and how that can without giving any of a way, I don&#8217;t want to say I&#8217;m going to do it and then I don&#8217;t do it, but getting people to go between the podcasts and the blog and keeping that conversation flowing in some way and somehow interjecting the comments in all of that. And it&#8217;s not going to be an easy task</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Different ways, isn&#8217;t it? Because you have on one hand you really want to engage with the podcast, you want to listen to every word that&#8217;s being said, but there are times when you might also just want read the LDR of that podcast and I&#8217;d like to say, okay, that podcast probably is not for me, but I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve read the headline into it. Are you going to commit yourself to a soccer match for 90 minutes or almost two hours, which is probably a lot of kicking balls back and forth. Or you&#8217;re going to say, no, give me the five minute highlight, that&#8217;s enough and if the match absolutely fantastic with quality soccer football, I&#8217;m going to go in and watch the full thing. Or if it&#8217;s a team or a category that you support, I&#8217;m definitely want to listen them know what the whole thing.<br />So I think the block is also a little bit of a bridge between the full commitment or just a really short version of that or if you have been intrigued by the podcast, a blog could be a way to express your gratitude, your follow up question, sharing it with somebody else because from there you have to learn the links to the podcast. I mean there&#8217;s so many different ideas to really use the podcast as the center of it all that again, Gravatar, it&#8217;s signposting to everything and everything around that particular topic and maybe write about references of other speakers or podcast made in the past, which you may not have discussed in the podcast itself. So I get really excited about this though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />You&#8217;re right because when I go through any transcript and it&#8217;s kind of what I was doing with BobWP a little bit is it&#8217;s like one question is a post in itself. Somebody has given you a direct answer to one specific problem or one specific challenge, but within those transcripts there is tons of information that can be pulled out and be very in themselves are little nuggets I call &#8217;em gathered throughout that are standalone because they really tell you something right there, maybe even something you can take action on or something. And by itself sometimes you miss those things because like you said, you&#8217;re listening to this long podcast for 45 minutes and that little piece comes in there and then it&#8217;s gone</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />And you want to maybe reference that to somebody else. It&#8217;s like, oh, was that 23 minutes or 28 minutes and then it&#8217;s kind of lost. You&#8217;re going to listen to the whole thing, maybe busy, but if the highlights are set of reference, quote that into a blog post. Yeah, that&#8217;s a good way to share that though. I was going to ask probably two questions. I know one of the biggest reservations to start</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a blog is your time commitment and I think in our discussion I&#8217;ve touched a little bit on that&#8217;s like don&#8217;t commit yourself to a weekly or a daily something just whenever it&#8217;s right, whenever you feel like it. And quite often a newsletter when you say, Hey, I have a weekly newsletter. That&#8217;s pretty tough to always fill a newsletter with something inside for every single week to the point that people actually might even be turned off by it because it&#8217;s the same stuff you read five times over everywhere you in the WordPress ecosystem. So on one hand you have the time commitment, which is really tough, especially if you have busy schedule and you have five recordings in one day. How can you commit yourself to writing these blog posts? Maybe there are hack tools and then the second part is publishing, and I know you alluded to that earlier. How do you get people then to read it and how do you get to publish it? I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned Jetpack. They have some publishing tools across many different networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And I think that is the challenge because nothing absolutely drives me more nuts than going to read a post and at the end of the post they say, we would love for you to leave a comment over on X and they give you a link about this post and I&#8217;m like, now you&#8217;re making me go back over there. But everybody tends to do that because that&#8217;s where they feel all the conversations. But also it&#8217;s a huge mess of stuff that just goes by quickly. I mean you need to do it, but the commitment I think some people spend on social is way beyond. I mean even though they feel there&#8217;s a lot of engagement, they&#8217;re looking at their views, this is viewed by 10,000 people, this is great. Well how did that all play out? What did you really get out of those 10,000 views? What engagement was there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />When you publish something to Twitter to X to Facebook and Instagram, it would be nice to have a link to those particular posts but also a little counter of what the engagement is on those or whether like 15 comments or 200 comments, it could be quite intriguing to actually go and discover that or even have some of that be reposted into the comments section of the blog to sort of bridge that data. I dunno how easy that is, but that really good truth for thought, what you just shared</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And somebody just shared recently a person that is using the Fediverse pulling in content and stuff, but on their site they&#8217;re pulling in all basically their feed of everything they say out there and it&#8217;s all living on their site as a one page is a long feed. I know that next time anybody&#8217;s at a WordCamp and you want to have a nice lengthy conversation about all of this kind of social stuff, I&#8217;m find Robert Windish from side, he&#8217;s thinking, how can we make WordPress a social platform and that means your blog and stuff like that. And he has a lot of really, I mean he will talk your ear off about it, but he has a lot of interesting ideas and he&#8217;s kind of on the mission himself and that kind of brings it in, how do you tie this all together? How do you still make your site the place where people will go to? And I think we&#8217;ve gotten out of that habit, the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Data liberation project, probably not excelling as far as we want. It&#8217;s not always about moving side to a different platform, but it&#8217;s also pulling in information from other platform into your own side, whether it&#8217;s private or in case of WooCommerce, it could be moving data from shipping platforms or accounting platforms but also public comments, relevant comment from social media into your own play. And I think again, what I said earlier that if everything you did or published is on WordPress that you can totally control with your own tools and what it looks like, how amazing is that? How many issues would would&#8217;ve prevent it? I think people will start to realize that as things mature, WordPress is always there and will always be there, even selling a hundred year plan. So I&#8217;m pretty confident that that&#8217;s going to be the case</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And I think is there&#8217;s, even though some people really dedicate themselves to maybe a certain platform or feel that even though they still have a site that more and more people are starting to think just can&#8217;t go on or continue this way, there&#8217;s a bit of frustration I think on some people&#8217;s level and a bit, I mean I&#8217;ve even cut down my time on social just because I feel like I&#8217;m just, yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s too much anymore. I still depend on RSS, that&#8217;s how I keep up on everything is my R SS feed and that I go in and check all the time. That&#8217;s the easiest way for me to do it and still the best way</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Controlling what comes into your inbox, what you read, what newsletter you subscribed, which block do you want to get into your feed. It&#8217;s super important that you take control over your own life. I noticed that with my own certain social media profile, how destructive it can be and we dunno quite what the result is going to be in 10, 20 years time and how their attention is going to be. But these are all challenges that we start to see the tip of the iceberg. I just want to go back because we brush over that creating the content, like writing the content and I know AI tools are big and they&#8217;ve been around for quite a few years and blogging you could almost just do it with a couple of prompts. What are your thoughts on that using AI tools in the broadest way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />For me personally, I don&#8217;t use it to create any original content. I&#8217;ve sometimes asked for a few ideas and even then it, it&#8217;s very rarely where I use it the most is repurposing content and that means existing content and I have exactly that through the transcripts. So when I mean my transcripts to give you an idea of my workflow with the transcripts, which makes sense, that leads into other content is when I get a transcript, I have it done through rev.com through their AI and I go through and I correct some of the names brands and then I take that same transcript and I run it through chat GPT and I tell it to just find any spelling errors or small grammatical errors. Sometimes you have to be careful with the prompt or it&#8217;ll actually start eliminating parts of the transcript. So I try to keep it to just really small things, which that usually fixes quite well and from that I&#8217;ll ask it to give me one or two paragraph intro to it and it&#8217;s never written exactly like I want, so I use it as a basis to just do something and then I&#8217;ll ask it for some key takeaways, which is where I think it is a lot better at and that&#8217;s the best use of it is on existing content, not on creating original content.<br />And then I would go through and make sure it reads and take out the word delve, which AI seems to love so much. Everybody delves into everything and it just drives me. But that&#8217;s where personally and I think where it works best, I&#8217;m at an advantage because I basically have original content through the audio. I just need to have that transcribed and then work with that content. But original stuff still for me personally has to come from my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />You could teach the LMS to be more like Bob and if you keep teaching it with your prompts probably can get much better in weeks and months to come, but that does take time. It needs to learn that as well. But that&#8217;s really interesting. I mean even just a few years back I recall you would send off your recording to be transcribed by somebody and it would be quite an expensive server and compare that now with these A alarms it&#8217;s an amazing value and so much faster and almost instant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s something, yeah, for years and years I paid Rev to do human transcripts and that budget became higher and higher as I did more content obviously and more podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Right. Then a little bit unpacking the part of publishing to where your audiences are, where your tribe is at, but I know in your case you have so many new audiences and communities across the globe speaking different languages. Do you track that? Do you analyze that or you don&#8217;t even go that fast right here it is. There are a few ways to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;ve tried to do it and there&#8217;s never a rhyme or reason for whatever happens with any content. I mean a certain spike in listen and sometimes you try to track it and you think was there somebody that just happened to share? It&#8217;s out there somewhere that you don&#8217;t know about and there&#8217;s no way you can track it because suddenly it&#8217;s just out of the blue you&#8217;ll have five, six times as many listens one day as you did for the last five days or something and you can go and look at that topic and often the topic doesn&#8217;t make sense either what made this happen or was it shared internally somewhere? How do you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Feel about others writing on your blog or for you, is that something, I know you talked about a little bit, but what are your thoughts around that? How far do you want to extend it? You want to keep it only within co-host or anybody that&#8217;s been on the podcast and even to the point where it&#8217;s almost could monetize the way because of anybody that publish on your platform with the audience that this build up there is some value to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, one of the wonderful things I have is I have a group of co-hosts. If I have an idea and this is how the newsletter thing is exactly what I did with that and I can bounce an idea off and when I bounce the idea of bringing a blog back right away, several of them were like, oh, I&#8217;d love to guess both. Which it&#8217;s not easy to get people to guess posts because it&#8217;s tough enough for them to write content for themselves. So for sure the hosts to me a no-br</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ainer, especially if they want to follow up or write about one of the shows they&#8217;ve recently done. The guests almost are a second no-brainer because the opportunity to give them to follow up on something or to add to the conversation say, wow, after the conversation I thought about this one piece or I thought maybe they want to elaborate on one thing they were asked, they answered it one minute, but they have a lot more to say. So those kinds of things, I think it&#8217;s ideal. The podcast is run by the community. I mean I do all the grunt work, but I host you. I bring in guest hosts and all these guests and I want the blog to be that too as far as open guest spots, but I&#8217;m going to be very selective. I don&#8217;t want tutorials, I don&#8217;t want them writing about their product. It&#8217;s not</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />The audience that you&#8217;ve built up. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And get the feedback as well in the bottom of the blog have some sort of rating tool that&#8217;s used for how would you rate this content? And so they kind of use that as a way of working where depending on the number of readers and the feedback that you get is better provide the content that readers are interested in. The other thing I saw that crossed my mind working with user levels within WordPress publisher and editor admin, whether certain speakers who might want to follow up on things or even add a supportive blog post, whether they have some sort of levels that they can add and own that piece of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I guess I could say get in the groove of how I do this with the post and I still want it to be that community oriented piece and I want them to feel like they have a bit of control over that. So it&#8217;s an interesting thing to think about because I think that&#8217;s an important part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s that community that you build up and it&#8217;s also back to the comments and empowering some writers to control and manage the comments and the conversation and that&#8217;s like bringing that back. It then becomes not quite a forum, but it is that engagement not just between the author and a few comments and that probably brings in more folks to then want to comment because they can get the audience with the speaker, with the writer and leave some nice words or ask for the question, what did you mean we did quote or does also apply to X, Y and Z. The other cool thing I found with the Jetpack tool, creating the social media images, so when you publish that something did you see that you add your featured image and a bit of text and within the post itself it generates a social media image that&#8217;s formatted for the different platform. Again, it&#8217;s one of those little hacks that just make so much easier to create a content, publish it and not be dragged down like, oh, I need to do this, I need to do that. And then weeks past you still haven&#8217;t published it because having that threshold as lowest as possible direct from public I think is key to just keep going. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s not perfect, even if it&#8217;s a light mistake, update it. Yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Exactly. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Just going back on the newsletters, because we have to bring that back in because that was the original idea is like I&#8217;m going to start with a newsletter and now we, instead of really focusing on blog, blog block and all the advantages, there&#8217;s still a place for newsletters. Where do you see that sort of fall into place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />When I visualize in my head for a newsletter and ideally what I like is I want to keep as much of this content on the site and drive people and have it as a teaser. And of course as it has been, or I guess you don&#8217;t call it newsletter, but when people get notified of a post, I mean just knowing this is a content and you can go back through and listen to what you want to read, what you want, but also is how to have that content go out automatically but also be able to add a little custom content to it to make sure that people, this is how you can more easily comment or by doing this and make it a little bit more visible. Add little snippets of something in there that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Quotes from the community like, oh, Ron said this on X and that followed up in a comment here and that&#8217;ve got some great conversation going, get engaged in this if you care about this stuff or here&#8217;s a quote, I got the community talking and it was relevant here and there. And yeah, it also a good way to introduce other platforms within the own ecosystem. If you have a guest speaker from a Woo ecosystem or from a third party developer, it&#8217;s nice to be able to reference that in a newsletter I get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential, but I don&#8217;t want to make the newsletter, like you said, this is kind of more of a prompt the newsletter. And what I really want to do is when I get this all in place and things moving along, my next endeavor is to get Matt Mullenweg on. I&#8217;d love to just talk with him about blogging, comment and ping backs</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />And did you now who is also fantastic, I know if that he should bring in a guest Tim Ferris and I know he and Matt have shared so many ideas around blogging, like long form short form. Also Seth Godin and I&#8217;ve written to some podcasts around how easy it is to share something or not at all really the thought process behind blogging and I think Matt is pretty good at that. He can share something very short, one paragraph and it&#8217;s out there or some really long bits of tech, but it&#8217;s the short ones that I&#8217;m going to take way more time to think that through. Very easy to talk and write paragraphs and paragraphs. At some point people will disengage and you kind of lost them, but keeping it super short and to the point that&#8217;s real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />And I think that&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m thinking about too is a lot of this and I think the site is ripe for that because there&#8217;s a lot of content we can share that is short and to the point rather than just going on and on and giving 11 tips of whatever. I mean those have its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah. Here&#8217;s another thing, you&#8217;re building up international communities and having the content of tribe or even the blog post, but having it with Google now, it&#8217;s so easy to have your full page translated as well. It&#8217;s almost instant. Well, it is instant. Which is a great way to repurpose content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />It is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />And both ways, if you have somebody writing in a lanugage that it also accessible to English speakers or to German speaker and yeah, that&#8217;s probably something that&#8217;s not talked about a lot, but super easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />That would be really interesting, like to open that up. We&#8217;ve done that to some effect with the one podcast where we have the community come in and talk about their own WordPress community and their locale and in their native language, and so they&#8217;re actually talking to their community. That&#8217;s another whole piece of it. And I think it is, you&#8217;re right, I know there&#8217;s podcasts in the space that does the podcast in several different languages. They actually have somebody do it in four or five languages. A little bit of the news, WordPress news, and I think there&#8217;s something there to be looked at for sure because we&#8217;re a huge community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />I haven&#8217;t checked the figures, but I would sort of maybe 60, 75% of Woo users don&#8217;t live in a country where English is the first language. So maybe two thirds who don&#8217;t have English foreign language, they speak English, but to truly engage with them anyway, I guess we&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that blogging is pretty cool. I think there is blogging for anybody for yourself, whether it&#8217;s a personal diary that you have public and then you have your personal one that you keep private, whether it&#8217;s for yourself or for your business, for your ecommerce site. I think blogging for the sake of SEO definitely has value, but I don&#8217;t think that should be the prime goal to block call because then you end up in not very pretty or very well organized content to hit certain keywords and I think that puts people off. But write it for your, like you do with social media, keep it short to the point with a link to your product, to your podcast, wherever you want people to go to or the call to action. I think that probably has a good reason to consider it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, for sure. And definitely I think we&#8217;ve touched on enough different thing given our thoughts. Some of the direction Do the Woo might go. So if there is not a perfect post to come in and comment, anybody listening to this, this is a post because we&#8217;ve talked about a lot of things and I&#8217;m sure everybody that&#8217;s listened to it has actually thought, well, yeah, that makes sense, or nope, this is the way I would do it or this is how it works for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />And maybe that&#8217;s the comment, call out what are the forms of blog posts or good examples of other forms of blog posts like rich content, whether it snippet the codes or a gallery photos or sound snippets or maybe a poll to get voting. That all can all be part of a blog pro. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be just paragraph or words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Right, exactly. So we&#8217;re going to encourage everybody listening now to come and leave a comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />I&#8217;m inspired now. I&#8217;m going to revisit my own site. I haven&#8217;t touched since I started working at quite a few years now. It&#8217;s all very well preaching about it, but maybe we should all get back to blogging. I think it&#8217;s a good way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well this has been great and yeah, everybody hope you enjoyed it and let us know your thoughts. You&#8217;ll go into the post, leave a comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />It&#8217;s been a great Blogstorm, Bob</p>\n\n\n\n<p>. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be right alongside there, at least in spirit one way or another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Yeah, I need to write one of the first posts or co-write to see what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Alright, Ronald, thanks everyone for listening and yeah, let us know what you think about all this stuff we were talking about. Alright, thank you all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald:<br />Thanks Bob.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong>, hosts <strong>BobWP</strong> and <strong>Ronald Gijsel</strong> kick up a blogstorm. What&#8217;s that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon here on this site you will see the blog as it returns and becomes a integral part of this builder and business community. BobWP and Ronald started brainstorming what the main goal of this blog would be offline, but it quickly ended when Ronald suggested we take it public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. A live and fun blogstorm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Return to Blogging</strong>: BobWP is considering bringing back the blog on Do the Woo after realizing the site felt incomplete without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Engagement through Newsletters</strong>: In our case, newsletters should serve as prompts to drive people to the blog for more content, rather than being long-form content themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content Strategy for Do the Woo</strong>: The blog will act as an extension of the podcast, with hosts and guests contributing posts that complement the podcast episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community-Driven Content</strong>: The podcast and blog will be community-oriented, encouraging interaction and engagement through comments and guest contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I<strong>mportance of Comments</strong>: BobWP believes in the value of comments and is exploring ways to drive more engagement and conversation through blog comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Social Media and Blog Content</strong>: There&#8217;s a need to balance content between social media platforms and the blog, ensuring the blog remains the central hub of activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leveraging Transcripts for Content</strong>: Transcripts from podcast episodes can be repurposed into blog posts, highlighting key takeaways and providing additional value to the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using AI for Content Repurposing</strong>: AI tools can assist in repurposing existing content, such as cleaning up transcripts and generating summaries, but not for creating original content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Embracing Multi-language Content</strong>: Considering the international nature of the audience, there&#8217;s potential to explore multi-language content to reach a broader audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Brand and Focus</strong>: BobWP is consolidating his efforts under the Do the Woo brand, using his Gravatar profile as the primary personal identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Encouraging Guest Contributions</strong>: There’s a strong interest in having guest posts from hosts and podcast guests to further enrich the blog’s content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Value of Owning Content</strong>: Emphasizes the long-term value of owning content through a blog, as opposed to relying solely on transient social media platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Utilizing Tools like Jetpack</strong>: Jetpack&#8217;s tools, such as social media image generation and cross-platform publishing, can simplify the process of maintaining and promoting the blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Driving Engagement through Follow-ups</strong>: Engaging the community by following up on podcast topics with blog posts, encouraging discussion, and fostering a deeper connection with the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building a Central Content Hub</strong>: The blog should serve as the central hub for all content, with social media and newsletters acting as feeders to drive traffic back to the site.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 09:05:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 84: A WordPress 6.6 Sneak Peek\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=17539\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/07/episode-84-a-wordpress-6-6-sneak-peek/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26873:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, as she offers an exclusive preview of the recently released WordPress 6.6, accompanied by special guest Meher Bala, the release&#8217;s coordinator.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Last week, we released WordPress 6.6, and I had a chance to chat with a long-time contributor and member of the Release Squad about it.&nbsp;Today, I have with me Meher, and she was, well I guess I will let her tell us what she did with the release, but at the time of this recording, yesterday we had the WordPress 6.6 release, codenamed &#8216;Dorsey,&#8217; and so Meher, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Meher:</strong> Hi, thank you for inviting me. It&#8217;s nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:09]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you do in the WordPress project, how long you&#8217;ve been contributing, and then the role that you played in our big, big mid-year release?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Meher:</strong> So my name is Meher. I&#8217;m a front-end developer. I&#8217;m also a CEO of KDC. I&#8217;m also a codable expert in WordPress. I started with contributing into the marketing field. Then, slowly, for 5.6, I got to be on the release squad, learned about training, about how the release goes, process happens. From that time onwards, I&#8217;ve been part of marketing or, basically, I&#8217;ve been part of the marketing team for all the releases. For 6.6, I picked to do the Release Coordinator, something different, something new, wanting to know what goes into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That is a big leap from like hanging out in marketing to going to be the Release Coordinator. Before we get into the release itself, just what made you think to yourself, I would like to do that? I would like to stand up and wrangle all of these contributors across the world. Make sure we get a release out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> I wanted to try something new. Like even in WordCamp, each role is different. So, even in the release, I wanted to try each different things. And like 5.6, I was in documentation. Then, I was in marketing. So then I got used to marketing, so I stick with my, no, I stuck with marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:40] <strong>Meher:</strong> So this time, I want to try something different, and I want to see, you know, how easy was it to be a Release Coordinator because it&#8217;s a Release Coordinator, see, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a like a big thing coordinating so many people so many different teams going on, working together, and so yeah, it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. I&#8217;m glad that you found it fun. I always worry when people make big shifts. I&#8217;m like, did we put enough documentation to make it clear? Are they going to find it easy to get started or not? And I think you did a really great job with it. So congratulations, since that happened just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes, less than 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So, from your position as the Release Coordinator, what are the biggest, like, one or two features that you really were excited to see get in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, one of the biggest features was the style override patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] <strong>Meher:</strong> Which I found very useful because a lot of people are using patterns. So, you know, patterns override; if you wanna change something on a specific page, it&#8217;s really useful then just to, you know, recreate a second pattern and then to match up and all. And second, which I liked as a user, was the publish box on the post becoming very clear, very, you know, cluster-free, very minimalistic, and just so comfortable that a normal user will actually understand what is there instead of going to each dropdown and figuring out what needs to be done. So, for me, I think as a developer and user, these two are the fun features, which I like, which 6.5 had, so. There are many other features as well. These are the two great features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I don&#8217;t think that anyone can argue about the importance of making things a little easier to see, a little easier to use. It&#8217;s been a little bit since WordPress was like fall into it easy to use. I feel like we have been the easiest of the robust CMS systems for like a long time. I know I said CMS systems. That&#8217;s like saying pin number. I know that the S in CMS is systems, but anyway, that notwithstanding, we&#8217;ve been the easiest of the complex solutions for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s always great when we, when we take a moment to be like, what could we make a bit easier to just like, no instructions required you get in there and you can tell like, what any individual thing will do without necessarily, like you said, having to go into drop downs and reading a bunch of stuff a little guesswork is okay. And also, it&#8217;s clear that none of it is dangerous. And so I think that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s a a good change myself. So, I agree with your assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So the style override patterns, that&#8217;s part of the suite of design tools that we&#8217;re pulling together, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> in your experience, you said you&#8217;re the CEO of your company, like in your experience, does that feel like something that&#8217;s super useful for agencies or particularly useful for freelancers, or should it generally be useful for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] <strong>Meher:</strong> It will be useful from a small business point to a freelancer as well because we always try, like, in each page, we always, you know, there is some bits repeated, you know, so, patterns makes it easier, and syndicate pattern makes it more easier so that you can just duplicate and have one place to change. And, like, you have ten pages, you have one pattern across ten pages. The 11th page, you want the same pattern, but little change in that. It&#8217;s easier. It&#8217;s good because you can just change on that page, one particular thing and still go in the parent and change other things to reflect in that. So it will be very helpful for freelancers, small agencies. I do see big agencies take advantage of it. So overall, it should help everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Good. Good. I, for one, isn&#8217;t it great when we can get a feature out that mostly is going to help everyone. But I have been especially interested in the features that we&#8217;re trying to get out that help that kind of like small to medium agency area. I feel like we have a lot of folks in the WordPress community who do exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re getting something together. You have a mostly what you need across your site. You have one style that&#8217;s out there, but there&#8217;s this one area that you want to have a little bit more personality or a little less personality, depending on what your client is looking for, like this one is applying for jobs, and it needs to be a little less exciting or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great that we have that option. So you don&#8217;t have to try to, I don&#8217;t know, hack your way through that. I know that we&#8217;re not a super get-in-there-and hack-on-it sort of group anymore these days, but I love that we still have that feeling of we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re going to make this a safe hacking space for you. Just get in there and make it work. So that&#8217;s excellent. Excellent. So for you, then, personally, cause you wear a lot of hats, you&#8217;ve your front-end developer; you&#8217;re running your company, you&#8217;re working, you&#8217;re a codable expert. You&#8217;ve got all these things. So from your perspective, what is the thing that got into this release that was a surprising, like a diamond in the rough for you, like a surprising good feature when you just thought it was like an important feature at some point? Was there one that seemed like it was a good idea but became a great idea by the time it was out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, I would say style variations because I did not expect the final style variation to be what it is. A theme developer can create the theme, can add styles, can add fonts, can give different design elements to the theme as a normal user when they when someone wants to just pull up a website, but they&#8217;re not good in design, or they don&#8217;t know which font to use. They choose which font, but then it doesn&#8217;t work. So if the theme provides an easy option just to shift the different styles they&#8217;re using and combining with the fonts. It is a much bigger opportunity for everyone because a normal user can just, they have a black and white site. I want to shift to a colorful site. Just go and see what the theme art has given you and shift it. So I think that I was surprised and I like the outcome. I&#8217;m sure my blogger friends also will like it because then they don&#8217;t have to depend on a designer to you know, give them color schemes and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. Yeah. So unrelated. It&#8217;s only, it&#8217;s kind of related. I shouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s unrelated. It&#8217;s all about WordPress. And now it&#8217;s about color palettes. So, I have a new design on my blog. And unfortunately I am the sort of person that does need a designer to tell me what I meant by the thing I thought. <span>And so, like, I had this idea of the sort of color palette that I wanted and was searching for color palettes inside themes, which I was not succeeding at.</span> And eventually I had a designer who was happy to help you figure this out and get something out there. And they got me something that&#8217;s absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s got an excellent color palette and they redid some images for me. So it looks nice and hip and feels kind of modern. I think it&#8217;s great. But the one thing that I consistently felt confident to mess with while I was in there, because I think they did some custom work in there too, is all of the stuff that&#8217;s included in style variations. Like, I&#8217;m not touching colors because I can&#8217;t put colors together to save my life. But I was pleasantly surprised also by that particular feature. It gives you a feeling of I can change the face of this through the fonts or whatever it is. And I think that&#8217;s a nice, a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> And it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a perfect combination. Color and font. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t know today&#8217;s time which font is good. Or which font is needed for an industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. Fortunately, I&#8217;m a site manager of one. And so I just had to ask myself if I liked the font and moved on from there. So, oh. So, like I said, as we&#8217;re recording this, we are less than 24 hours past the release. How was your experience with this release? Was it enjoyable? Did it like expand your horizons? Were there surprises in how a release is run?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:43] <strong>Meher:</strong> There was no surprises because I&#8217;ve already been a part of a release. So I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s&nbsp;fair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Meher:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s depends on what happens on the day.&nbsp;But yes, behind the scenes, following up, just checking in to make sure, are we on time, do we need more time, or what needs, you know, how much more time is required. It was fairly good, I was only clearly concerned about on the day of the release, because there&#8217;s a lot of things to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Meher:</strong> Usually, the party of the beta and the RCs finish in less than hour or so. But the final has a lot more detailed steps and many people to ping, to get, you know, them on the day of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, for folks who have never watched a release happen. So, I think a lot of the folks who listen to this podcast, they find it in the dashboard, they don&#8217;t necessarily contribute to WordPress. But, like, if you&#8217;ve never watched a WordPress release, we have these release parties for every beta that goes out, every release candidate that goes out, and then the general release. And I always find them so fascinating because, we have hundreds of contributors over the course of an individual release. And then we have probably 50, 60 people who show up at, for some of you all, in the middle of the night and are just being directed, like their attention is just being directed here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I love watching it because I, I&#8217;m always in the release channel. I&#8217;m in the core channel. All of these are in Slack. And then I&#8217;m also in the admin channel where you have to do the flipping of switches and packaging things. And it&#8217;s really interesting to see, almost like a scan of a brain where things are lighting up for various things. <span>Like, you do the pre-testing in the release channel, and then you do the general testing in the core channel.</span> And then we&#8217;ve got like a person who&#8217;s flipping switches in the back, in the admin area to make sure that it all gets together. And it&#8217;s just really interesting to see how it all works. And yeah, it&#8217;s a really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listener, if you have never, if you&#8217;ve never done this, you have another opportunity. And I think the next release is early in November or something. And even if you&#8217;re there as like a spectator, not necessarily ready to take part in the release, sometimes it&#8217;s kind of nice to see how much effort and how many people are showing up to work on any individual release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:01]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;This was your first time to lead the release parties, though, right?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes. My first time releasing a release party. Also, to the spectators who have never been a part of release, you can just come and say hi. Like, yesterday, on the day of the release, there was one participant who joined for the first time, and she did contribute.&nbsp;And she was amazed by how smooth it went through. And for me, the best part of any release is seeing the green tick when people start testing. So, you know, everything is smooth sailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Meher:</strong> And we&#8217;ll reach the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s, it is a real testament to how well and how closely all of these folks can work together, which if you stop and think about the fact that everybody&#8217;s like all over the world, it&#8217;s all across the globe that this is happening. It is why WordPress works, right? All of these people, all of you coming together to do this on behalf of this software. How cool that you had somebody who joined for the first time and then they were able to contribute immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:04] <strong>Meher:</strong> Also, there are a lot of folks who&#8217;ve done it. So they&#8217;re always ready to help out. You know, if you&#8217;re stuck somewhere, as a first-time release lead, there were certain questions I had. There are a lot of people to guide you to the right direction or to say, this needs to go here, or you need to tell the audience this. A lot of support you get from the squad itself, plus the people who are not on the squad and who&#8217;ve done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Absolutely. I remember the first release that I led I was the coordinator of it and I believe it was 5.0. I believe it was the one that we put Gutenberg in core with, and it was the most terrifying thing I&#8217;d ever done. Not because I hadn&#8217;t been watching these releases happening for years, but because it&#8217;s different participating and watching and then being the person who is like you said, like making sure that things are still going on time that you understand when you need to say, like, there&#8217;s no way that this works for users right now. We have to take it out and all those things. And then, yeah, the day of, the first time that you have to run one of those global meetings, be like, &#8216;everyone, we don&#8217;t have time for this. Move on&#8217;. That&#8217;s always a really hard first time. Well, cool. That&#8217;s so exciting. So I have a last question for you, and that is, you&#8217;ve kind of let us into it, for first-time contributors to a release, especially anyone who&#8217;s thinking about joining the release squad for the first time, do you have any advice, anything that you wish you had been told when you were coming into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Come with an open mind and come with a thought that there are people to help you. Ask in any channel. There will be someone or the other who will answer you immediately or a little later, depending on the time zone, and will guide you to the right person or right documentation where you can read up because there is a lot of documentation, good documentation on releases, how it handles and what team is needed, what they are supposed to do. So, you, you have a friendly bunch of people. Just ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. I love it. I love that advice. That was really good advice. Don&#8217;t be scared. Everybody has answers, and they want to give them to you. I agree. That is a real strong truth for the WordPress project. Last thoughts: anything you want to share with the WordPress community with our community of listeners here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> Looking forward for new people joining the next release and seeing 6.7 new features, which I&#8217;m excited about, collaborative phase three coming into picture and excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So you can come join us, make.WordPress.org/core, or you can join us in the Slack instance. You can go to chat.WordPress.org and get signed up for that. We coordinate all of this in the core channel, and we hope to see every new contributor that&#8217;s been on the fence. We hope you show up. There&#8217;s a new meeting every two weeks just for y&#8217;all. Meher, this has been an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:56] <strong>Meher:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:58] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hopefully, you&#8217;ve had a chance to download the release and try it out on your own sites. As always, if you run into any bugs, let us know so that we can get them in the next point release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. I have a moderate-sized small list. The first one is that WordPress is a reminder, actually. It&#8217;s a lot of reminders this week if I get right down to it, but this first one is a reminder that one of our big-picture goals for 2024 was getting new users into our event series. Our goal, of course, is to warmly welcome more first-time attendees and new users, and future WordPressers at all of our events, and that&#8217;s something that you can help get done. So, for all of our event organizers, or if you have not organized an event yet and would like to, just so that you can meet the fellow WordPressers in your area or, get to grow your own network a little bit. We&#8217;ve got a few best practices that can help you to make sure that you have a good experience for first time attendees. For one, you should always consider some thoughtful event design. Craft your events with some first-time attendees in mind. You have to consider their needs and interests and potential barriers to participation. Second, it helps to have some targeted messaging. Ensure that you have promotional materials that highlight the benefits of attending, but also what new knowledge, skills, or professional connections folks will gain when they come. It&#8217;s also good to share success stories of past first-time attendees. And then just kind of a final note for that on outreach strategies. You should experiment with a range of marketing channels to reach professional new attendees. You can partner with local schools, professional organizations, and online communities who can help to spread the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on our small list of big things is a reminder that the Docs Team holds an online Contributor Day every fourth Tuesday. They&#8217;ve been doing this for about a year now. And I think that it&#8217;s one of the most engaging and fun new contributor experiences we have, which I realize might sound odd for documentation, but it&#8217;s a great team. It&#8217;s got a great number of team reps in it. And they&#8217;re looking for you. They&#8217;re looking out for you to come and join for your first time on a Contributor Day. The next one is actually tomorrow, July 23rd. I&#8217;ll have a link for that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the third thing on our list is a reminder about online workshops. These are live sessions where you can learn alongside other WordPress enthusiasts, and they&#8217;re, you know, safe spaces where you can come as you are, develop new ideas, explore issues that you&#8217;re having, ask questions, network over shared interests, exchange theories, collaborate, and honestly, thrive on a bit of problem-solving together. New workshops are happening all the time. You can check out the schedule to join in on a live session and even watch some of the previous sessions to see if it&#8217;s for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the final thing on our list is that there is a recap up of the first Media Corps Briefing that was held on June 27th, and it provided media partners with an overview of the Source of Truth and updates that were planned for WordPress 6.6, that was released last week. Obviously, we just talked to Meher about it. But that particular session featured guest Anne McCarthy, who explained and demoed some of the upcoming features and answered a bunch of questions from the participants. The briefing was recorded and published on the WordPress YouTube channel. Apart from the recording, you can also find a summary, the full transcript, and other relevant links from the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:42]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

In today&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll talk about block themes, Gutenberg 18.8, WordPress 6.6, and so much more. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Core, Open Source Project sponsored by Automattic Five For The Future Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m delighted to have with me on the show Carolina Nymark, core contributor, sponsored by Yoast. She writes on fullsiteediting.com and she regularly updates and adds features to the Gutenberg plugin and block themes, and she&#8217;s from Sweden. Thank you so much for being on the show. How are you today, Carolina?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Hi, I&#8217;m well, thank you. June was a very hot month, but July has actually been a little bit cooler. We have had some rain here just outside Stockholm, so it&#8217;s been nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So yeah, the rain&#8230; In Germany it&#8217;s still very hot or it&#8217;s up and down. It was cooler earlier this month, but it&#8217;s now really, really hot. And I&#8217;m glad, I&#8217;m going out to the lake or maybe I&#8217;m going to go jump into the lake that&#8217;s a little bit southeast of Munich over the weekend. So hopefully the weather holds to actually have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> That sounds amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, well, we&#8217;ll see. We are also working on the house of my parents, to fix some of the things, and I don&#8217;t know how much time we&#8217;re going to have. Yeah. So yeah, let&#8217;s just get into the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements &#8211; WordPress 6.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-awaited release of WordPress 6.6 happened earlier this week and it&#8217;s named Dorsey after the legendary American big band leader, Tommy Dorsey, with the smooth sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release post actually sports a Spotify link with a playlist of his great songs. It took about 630 contributors from 51 countries, and this release also welcomed over 150 first-time contributors. That&#8217;s a huge number every time we have a release with the new contributors. So I&#8217;m really happy that we can onboard so many new contributors and get them on the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, since the roadmap came out on 6.6 in March, we talked about the upcoming releases quite a bit. So for you Carolina, the next question I ask almost everybody who was on the show, what are the most exciting updates in WordPress 6.6 for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>Well, I hope this isn&#8217;t too repetitive, but there are several things. The updated block style variations or section styles is a great addition. It helps users quickly select a pattern or a part of a page and just really changes the style of it. It helps WordPress developers to work faster as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard some rumors that this is only a feature for block themes, and that is not true. You can use these section styles even in classic themes, as long as you&#8217;re using the block editor. Because you do not need to use JSON or a theme JSON file to register these. You can register them with PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s true. Yeah. The block styles have been in Gutenberg for a long time, but the section styles are just coming in that you have a group of blocks that the styles apply to for the container blocks, like the group blocks, the columns block, and what was the other one? Was it media text?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Cover perhaps. I&#8217;ve mainly been testing it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, with the cover. Yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re testing them out? You were going to say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I was going to move on to my next favorite feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. So let me just say that we have in the show notes two things for you, dear listeners. And that&#8217;s going to be the dev notes about sections styles. And also the latest developer blog post about styling sections, nested elements, and more about the block style variations in WordPress 6.6. So what else is exciting for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>We have the update where we&#8217;re using theme version three, which solves problems with the font size and spacing presets. And the presets are the default values that WordPress adds. So before we can upgrade to version three, of course the developers need to learn about the changes. And they need to decide if they actually want to upgrade or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is going to depend on, well, which WordPress version do you need to support you. If you&#8217;re supporting WordPress 6.6 and forwards, then you can definitely switch to version three. But if you still need to support, I don&#8217;t know, 6.0, 6.3 and so on, then you have to consider this more carefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course there&#8217;s been many discussions about this with theme developers, especially in WordCamp Europe. And so for example, their discussions about, so if I switch to version three, I&#8217;m also going to have to update the spacing that I&#8217;m using inside the templates. And again, we come back to, okay, so if I update the template, how do I make sure that the end user knows that there is a theme update, that to actually receive this update to the template they might have to go and reset the template on their installation. It&#8217;s just tricky. It&#8217;s an important decision to make if you&#8217;re supporting many different WordPress versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That has always been a bigger problem for theme developers when they update their templates and the user has modified the templates through the Global Styles, that the updates are not overwriting those. Because the user has the latest priority or the highest priority. So a theme update wouldn&#8217;t necessarily come through and make this available for all the sites. Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t go away with the theme JSON version though, version 3, but it makes it probably a little easier. But what will make it easier is another feature we&#8217;re going to talk about, but I just wanted to point out as a side note that Carolina Nymark has updated pages on the fullsiteediting.com site to include all the new developments and updates, and I think there are five pages that were updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one on Global Styles and theme JSON. Theme JSON color options and typography options for fun, size, line height, font rate and more, and then how to add shadows with the theme JSON. So the great site, fullsiteediting.com that focuses so much on block theme, teaches you even more on the new developments. So thanks, Carolina, for putting all the work in. Yeah, so what&#8217;s next? So we had the style sections, we have the theme JSON changes, and then&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> We also have the overrides for synced patterns. This helps you to keep the overall form, shape, the sign of parts of the content that they have inserted, but still change part of the content. For example, if you have this group block with the specific image and the heading that highlights your feature and the button, then maybe you want to use different images and you can go in and only change that image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a great tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> And go update. So it&#8217;s not super easy to explain, but yes, it&#8217;s very helpful for site creators. From a theme developer perspective, there&#8217;s not much one can do with the overrides for synced patterns, since themes cannot register synced patterns, only regular standard patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s no attribute that I as a theme developer can add, for example, to my patent PHP file to make it synced on theme activation. That doesn&#8217;t exist. But hopefully we can continue working on that and find ways to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so let me unpack that for a little bit. So if a user wants to create a synced pattern and use one of the theme patterns as a blueprint for that, they need to use the duplicate feature in the panel manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then switch on the synced part and preferably also rename it so they don&#8217;t see it twice in the list of patterns.But then if the pattern gets updated through the theme, they could see it, but their duplicate version won&#8217;t update. So they need to take care of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I like the synced pattern for site builders, because it releases quite a few headaches that you had before. That you couldn&#8217;t update the patterns and styles through the Global Styles, now you can. And now you can also have your users or your other editors use the same and just change your mind about the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> It helps if you have editors and you only want them to be able to edit specific things, then the synced patterns with overrides definitely helps with that. That&#8217;s one of their biggest purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Also for myself, if I had a pattern that I can change the content of it more and more or more often, and reuse it for a book review or for just a call for action. And I always have the same design, but the call to action is a different one. It also helps me as a site owner quite a bit to streamline my processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, so developer block has an introduction to the overrides in synced patterns. That will be interesting to learn about, if you want to read, if you want to learn about it. And then also link an iteration tracking issue for synced pattern in WordPress 6.7. It&#8217;s still named a draft, but it has, when you look at it, it lists all the issues that theme developers had with the synced patterns and that they want to get fixed or enabled or feature requests. And one of them is actually make synced patterns available for theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also great discussions from quite a few theme developers in the community that have been vocal about that, and the responses from the developers like Riad bringing it all together in an overall model for synced patterns. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to how that works going to progress. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s going to be coming to WordPress 6.7, because we only would know by the end of September, but there&#8217;s two months or two and a half months to go to actually work on that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I&#8217;m just thinking that two and a half months, it&#8217;s a very short time. The release squad for the 6.7 release, the post where you can sign up or actually apply to be part of the release squad has been up. I guess we&#8217;ll know more later next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I think so. I&#8217;m going to put it in the show notes, what you&#8217;re just saying, the post with a proposal for the release and raise your hand if you want to be part of it. And there&#8217;s also a section, on the core block was another post that was, what would you like to see in the theme Twenty Twenty Five?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because every year the last release of the year also comes with a new default theme. And I&#8217;m looking forward to what&#8217;s going to be next in there, and how many of the features that we are talking about right now are coming into the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yes, absolutely. So there actually is a GitHub repository already open for Twenty Twenty Five, where you can submit issues with what we&#8217;d like to see. For example, maybe you want to see an example of how we see negative margins. Or maybe you want to see the new grid variation, which is now&#8230; So the grid has been available in WordPress, but it hasn&#8217;t had the same kind of UI interface and options that we see in 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in 6.6 we have the grid as a group variation. I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more about how to actually use these settings. I&#8217;m not familiar with them yet. Actually I do find it a little bit confusing. So I have to really set dedicated time to learning this. So we have the grid and we are able to, for example, set how many columns we want in the grid. We can adapt how our content inside the grid will flow into a different row, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you have to go and select there the block that is inside the grid and decide, do I want this particular block to be two columns wide? Or do I want it to be two rows, for example? So once I feel comfortable with that and know how it works, then I think we&#8217;re going to be able to create some really interesting layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you do. And there was a hallway hangout and you provided that link to it also with Isabel Bryson who actually worked quite a bit on that feature. And she showed off how she&#8217;s going to use it or how she worked on it and what you can do with it. I really liked the way that you could say, okay, any column that is in the grid needs to be&#8230; Or any cell that needs to have a minimum width of 300, and then it automatically flows with the screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if it&#8217;s a mobile screen, then you get them all stacked, and if it&#8217;s a tablet, you get two columns, or maybe&#8230; Nah, three is probably not wide enough. And then when you&#8217;re on the big screen you get as much as the layout of your website allows, and stack them, have three or four in a row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really good. And it&#8217;s a responsive way to make your layouts without having to think about responsiveness. So I think that&#8217;s a great feature for users because it&#8217;s a new concept anyway, and our users that haven&#8217;t been able to create layouts or do some editing on their theme or of their headers and that, there is another jump there to make to get the concepts right. Because I think we have some anecdotal evidence that for some people it was hard to figure out are we editing a template or am I editing this particular page?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are then surprised when they thought they&#8217;re editing a page that it changed for the whole site. So yeah, there are now a few guardrails in the site editor. I&#8217;m not sure if there are enough, but I&#8217;m also thinking that it gets better and better the more people are using it and the more people get confused and talk about it to find the right way to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a grid layout, you don&#8217;t have to think about that much. That&#8217;s a concept that people can really adhere to or find, maybe not that hard to&#8230; I saw quite a few of those layouts where you have a stacked group block inside a grid cell and those are really cool. Or have a row inside a grid cell. And those behave really well also in the responsiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m excited about the grid layout. I&#8217;m really waiting for a masonry grid layout that goes with the flow in every direction. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s yet available. I have the feeling they&#8217;re not, but there are some experiments that you can&#8230; If you use the Gutenberg plugin there&#8217;s an experiment page and you can switch on interactive grid layouts and do even more experiments, explorations with that feature for 6.7. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah. I definitely have to go and check that out. One thing that I would like to see, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s possible, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s possible, but when you have a query loop and you have the post-template block inside of it, you have the option to select between lists and the grid. And I would like that grid option that you select in the toolbar of the post-template block to have the same type of options. So that I would be able to have&#8230; Maybe I want the second post in my query to be two rows tall, for example. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Not yet. I had the same question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Have all the signs for the post. Well the thing is, it&#8217;s a loop, so of course it loops through every post. I&#8217;m not sure&#8230; We&#8217;ll get to that later when we talk about the plugin, I think. Because in the query loop, of course you can&#8217;t add it. If you add a block to your post-template it&#8217;s going to be the same block, same text for whatever these posts. I&#8217;m not sure if it would be possible to have one post to be taller or wider than everyone else. Unless of course you want to go and do custom CSS, which is absolutely possible. But from the editor, I&#8217;m not sure, but I would really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. In the editor it&#8217;s not possible yet. I did, well many, many years ago, a layout for a news outlet that had I think six columns and the main post was three columns wide and then one was two column, one column and underneath there were six different posts that are kind of in the header section. And that&#8217;s not available yet, that you can&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> No, exactly. So if you wanted, for example, one full word sticky post you&#8217;d have to use, today you&#8217;d use custom CSS to achieve that. Or maybe you&#8217;d even have two query loops, which of course at some point it&#8217;s going to be a performance issue if you have to do it twice. But you can&#8217;t do that with the options on the block now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Maybe we can&#8230; One can say that the sticky post is always, I don&#8217;t know, two columns or three columns. But yeah, it&#8217;s all&#8230; Because all of a sudden everybody has a different need and then I cannot imagine the interface, how many dials. And so you could offer the user, though they have every use case in there. But yeah, we&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s going to be possible later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m thinking that that&#8217;s also a great place for plugins to extend the core blocks to use the grid block in certain ways and try that out to say, okay, what is possible and push the limits a little bit on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s going to be responses now saying, oh, but this has existed in my plugin for three years. Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Sadly I have not seen it. I do not have time, there&#8217;s many page building plugins or block collections, unfortunately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. All right. So as I said, so I think, is there anything else from WordPress 6.6 that stands out for you apart from those theme-related features?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I&#8217;m a theme nerd. Everything is theme-related. We have the background. So the background image settings where you can now add the background image to various blocks and to the site wide Global Styles from the site editor for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have mixed feelings about this because I&#8217;m glad it is more now&#8230; It has a higher&#8230; How to say? It matches the customized settings better where you could add the background image. But I&#8217;m a little concerned that we are going to end up with these group blocks where people are adding text on top of the image and the text is not going to be readable, it&#8217;s not going to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think all the design tools bring hives to some designers because they don&#8217;t think that a lot of WordPress users are good designers, so they shouldn&#8217;t have access to those tools. And I&#8217;m reminded that there was a big movement in the internet, it&#8217;s called GeoCities or MySpace, where you had all those tools already at your fingertips. And there were quite some funky signs out there. But that&#8217;s kind of the creativity that is bred when you give people tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> That&#8217;s when we used the tables, HMO tables to other layouts and we had the dancing baby in the diaper and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Chip animations, yeah. Using spacer. But we found that spacer images are coming back with the spacer block, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>Mm-hmm. Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. So again, we are going to talk about this, about improving the block supports. So in the Gutenberg 18.8, we&#8217;re adding shadow supports for groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I don&#8217;t know if I should bring this now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s your PR, right? Well let&#8217;s talk about it when we go through the Changelog and we&#8217;ll be there in about 2 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah. In relation to the space block, so we are now not only adding the shadow, we&#8217;re working now for the next release. To add color options and spacing options to more blocks to make it more consistent. Because we have text-based blocks. It doesn&#8217;t even have text color. One of these ideas is of course, are we going to have a background on the space block or not? That discussion might be interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Indeed, indeed. Because there are also some great separator blocks and spacer blocks. It&#8217;s kind of both. Yeah, right, it&#8217;s a spacer or a separator that has some design to it. And the other CSS you can do some really funky things with waves and going from triangles and that kind of thing. And different kinds of patterns, how the background shines into the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I like those. I&#8217;m thinking maybe putting a plugin together with, there was a site that has a lot of separators CSS already displayed, and you can probably fairly easy, add them to a plugin so people can have an additional&#8230; So it&#8217;s a web dev separator generator, that&#8217;s called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah. Okay, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m going to look at that. It&#8217;s from the W Web Dev, GitHub group. So I&#8217;ll share the link in the show notes and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah, a plugin would be a good idea for that. Because it can of course be used in any theme. The problem with doing this kind of thing, like a pattern, if you wanted to do the pattern and submit it to the pattern directory, is that you can&#8217;t use custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Or add it to a theme, but then it&#8217;s not going from theme to theme. Yeah. Then it&#8217;s not&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: No, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It kind of goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Omitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Oh, right. I know that we can talk about quite a few things and we will, but today, just right now this minute, I wanted to do a side note. Because with all the features that come to developers and for no-code site builders in WordPress 6.5 and 6.6, you might not need to create a custom block to extend core functionality, that much anymore, because you could use block bindings or you could use other tools. That is not that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on July 23rd, JuanMa Garrido and Nick Diego will hold developer hours again, and with the title Do You Really Need a Custom Block? And they will explore with you, their listeners if you want to join them, how to add new functionality to core blocks by content only editing and the allowed blocks attribute and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of people review their custom blocks if they couldn&#8217;t replace them with patterns because they don&#8217;t have to maintain so much code or integrate block bindings and block variations. Well block variations, you need a little bit more development there. When effective block blocking and naming as well as of course our latest, most favorite feature synced pattern overrides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So July 23rd, a 1500 UTC, that will take place. It&#8217;s a live stream on Zoom and that&#8217;s 9:00 AM eastern in the US, 1500 UTC, 9:00 AM Eastern on July 23rd. And also for the same topic, there is also a developer blog post out that lists 15 ways to curate the WordPress editing experience from disabling specific blocks. So panel directory or unregistered formatting for the rich text block to disabling certain sidebar panels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know switching on and off for features is really important for clients and content creators, that it&#8217;s a major concern for agencies and publishers. And we talked about it earlier as well. And this post is a great snippet collection. It also points it to the right places in the documentation and there are always ways to disable custom colors and core presets in the theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m sure the Full Site Editing Global Styles and theme JSON has some notes about that too. So that&#8217;s kind of about the overall WordPress experience. Do you want to comment on any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I&#8217;ll try to attend. It&#8217;s sounds really like an interesting call. Yeah, I enjoyed the post about the 15 ways to security experience as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 18.8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, so we&#8217;ve come to what everybody&#8217;s waiting for, is what&#8217;s Gutenberg 18.8? So 211 PRs merged into the plugin release. 57 of those were enhancements, 77 were bug fixes and 35 of those bug fixes were actually back ported to core and made it into WordPress 6.6 and were included in the release candidate three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s all snow from yesterday, as we say in Germany, badly translated of course. But it&#8217;s in 6.6. Sixty contributors worked on this release, 10 of them, again, first-time contributors, so congratulations to all. So what&#8217;s in there is a good mixture between experimental stuff, updates on UI as well as some developer stuff and of course bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the one new feature that comes in as an experiment is the data form. We know about data views. That&#8217;s how all the list views in WP admin could look. When you look at the site editor, you see how pages could look and patterns and all that, organized in new views and grid layouts and all that. But what it does not have yet is a data form component. And this is now implemented as a first prototype in the iteration process to duplicate page actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is a modal that opens up and you get a form, you have to fill that in and hit a submit button, and that is the prototype that comes in. But take a look at it, if you&#8217;re a plugin developer, you probably can already see how that works for your plugin maybe, or how that can go into the WordPress 6.7. I think it&#8217;s still an experiment though. It hasn&#8217;t been released as an official or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I&#8217;m not sure actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, no, it&#8217;s actually in the plugin. It&#8217;s not an experiment, any duplicate&#8230; So it&#8217;s in the duplicate action that you can see. So when would you duplicate it? You would duplicate a pattern, you would duplicate a page, you would duplicate a template. Yeah, so all these duplicate actions will use that component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;ll help with the consistency and also of course make it easier to reuse these forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And also have a standard way of doing forms and you don&#8217;t have to make decisions as a plugin developer on, how do I do this? Use the form. But it&#8217;s not there yet. But what is an experiment is having&#8230; So we have pages, we have patterns, we have templates, we have styles, template parts, which are our patterns, what we don&#8217;t have in the new admin section are posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still have to get out and go into the WP admin to add that and you still would have to do this. But there is a PR in this release where it at least has the framework around to putting a post list into the data we use as well. This is an experiment that needs to be enabled through the experiments page of the plugin. The next thing is yes, you know all about it. Carolina, is that support for shadows for the group block. Yay. We were waiting for it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I received so many comments in praise for this and I&#8217;m like, okay, thank you. But sorry, this change it&#8217;s&#8230; So when you create a block support, you create these setting and the UI for it and you do that once. Because it&#8217;s the support blocks opt into it, compared to a block attribute, which normally is unique and only developed for that single block. So when you enable support on new blocks or in your plugin, you change maybe three lines of code and then you&#8217;re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is usually how it works. And this is how it worked for the group block shadow. It was a very simple change. We needed to do some manual testing to see about how to consider the overlap and the shadow was very long. Do we need to do something about that? And we ended up not doing anything, except labeling it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and with the&#8230; Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yeah. There are some other blocks where it&#8217;s not as simple. We are discovering bugs recently, early this week, not in this plugin release, but maybe the next one or the next after that. We found that there were still some remaining styles from the list block that affected other blocks that used the list element. So that was fixed, so that&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we discovered this one when we added background color and realized, wait a minute, the background color, it&#8217;s a little bit off here. So that&#8217;s how we discovered it. So sometimes it&#8217;s very easy to do this, but I also have a pull request for adding the border to the site logo, which has been going on since Twenty Twenty Three. And that is way more complex because we have to work with a link. Without a link we have to work with a resizer, have to work with a cropping tool and so on. So that one is not merged yet. But I&#8217;m hoping to get reviews of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting to look behind the scenes, how complicated they can be. And when you think that something that is newer, because the group block is relatively new in comparison to other blocks, they fit into the architecture better because it&#8217;s a more formal architecture, that wasn&#8217;t the case earlier on. And so yeah. But thank you so much. And also looking at that. Sometimes it&#8217;s easy and sometimes it&#8217;s hard. And we do it because it&#8217;s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> It&#8217;s interesting that way. It&#8217;s definitely challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And talking about some quality of life around blocks, not quality of life, but a QA around blocks. There was also an effort from quite a few developers amongst them, Maggie Cabrera, to add example snippets, two blocks, especially the query block, the post list, the excerpt block, log in log out block. So when you hover over them in the inserter that you see on the right-hand side, what kind of block is that? Some of the core blocks don&#8217;t have that and this was an oversight that has now been rectified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this is just going to make it a little bit more smoother and make it a little bit more consistent. The next one is&#8230; I wanted to put out is from the inserter, that the PR says, remove the dialogue behavior and that is the behavior, that when you click on things something opens up. And when you&#8217;re done, click in there. And you&#8217;re done with it, it closes automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the inserter and sometimes it&#8217;s a little bit of a harder&#8230; Was harder to use, because you had to click every time you wanted to add a block and open it up again. And now with that changed behavior you can now have it open and add multiple blocks at the same time to canvas. So this is definitely a quality of life for streamlining the workflow for creating content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is what you already mentioned, block background UI controls and have the controls move to a popover, so there&#8217;s background images. The blocks have gotten quite a few refinements in 18.8. Do you want to talk about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> It&#8217;s a bit changed in the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s definitely also streamlined and consistent through the&#8230; Global Styles, you can add background to blocks through the Global Styles as well as through the blocks, properties or settings. So they also streamlined those processes. The next one I found interesting was&#8230; That&#8217;s about the group block and they had a name, they renamed the fill feature to grow and that indicated&#8230; Can you explain what that indicates?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I read the pull request, so it&#8217;s partially to make the name a better match with the CSS functionalities behind the scenes. But it&#8217;s also about not mixing the fill in this context with the background color fill or the background image. So that&#8217;s the reason why they changed this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah. So it&#8217;s easier for people to translate and not have overlap ideas about things. But it also, I think the fill only has the connotation that it&#8217;s a fixed width, to be filled. And with grow it also indicates that it grows with the blocks that come in. So when you put a bigger one in there and that grow part, that&#8217;s what those CSS is actually for. The property is called grow as well. Yeah, flex-grow. It&#8217;s for the flex CSS there. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Yeah. And then of course that&#8217;s a great thing, is we get color support for the list item. Now we can have stripes in our list. In each list item could have a different color and that is really cool. Talking about designs, can you also grade gradients around it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I haven&#8217;t tried it. I would definitely look. I&#8217;m looking forward to hopefully seeing some kind of border support. Because I would like to sometimes have my list items like underlined. That&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So the underlying feature is not available for lists in the inline?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>Well, I don&#8217;t necessarily want to underline text, as in it being your name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, you want the same. Yeah, you want the same link of it? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Like the whole list item. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I&#8217;m going to try out the list block color support with some funky designs maybe over the weekend. It&#8217;s really cool. Then the next one is, that&#8217;s a small change, but it definitely clears up a lot of questions that came in through user support or that the justification formatting is also coming to the block toolbar in addition to that is in the sidebar because most people didn&#8217;t find it in the sidebar when they were looking for it and thought it wasn&#8217;t possible to justify a certain block or a certain series of blocks. So now it&#8217;s also available in the toolbar. That&#8217;s restricted to a few blocks I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yes. It&#8217;s largely inconsistent what&#8217;s in the toolbar and what&#8217;s in the sidebar for different blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> True. Let&#8217;s say if the pull request probably mentions if it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s definitely available for the flex box in the group log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I only see the post content that the group mentioned, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8230; I think that was just an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s for the group block. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s going to come to columns as well. Yeah, we need to test this. Dear listeners, we haven&#8217;t tested this little thing yet, sorry. But if you test it, send in what you think of it and how you use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I like that these things are going to be consistently updated anyway and somebody notices it and says, okay, I&#8217;m going to fix it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the next item is a change in the block API. That&#8217;s more for developers. It&#8217;s very technical, but it allows a custom block developer to add a file name to the variations fields of the custom block that they&#8217;re building. So you can create a block and then you also assign variations to it. And then if you don&#8217;t want it all in the same file, you can add a file name to the variations field and then it pulls it from there. Very nifty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah. And especially now if we&#8217;re saying that the number of variations that the block has&#8230; Like the grid block, that it keeps growing. It&#8217;s definitely absolutely useful for block developers because the grid block now has four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, just kind of thinking, but that was style variations one, not block variations. So we have a proliferation of the word variations and styles and blocks and you can mix it anywhere we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yeah, block style variation, block variations. It&#8217;s very similar. Also in the interface, they&#8217;re also very closely positioned in the interface. As long as you have opened the styles panel, you can have the variation just below the block name or then the description and then you have the style variation inside the panel. Also at the very top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. They all look the same. So if you&#8217;re a visual person, like I am. I always know where something stood in a book, I knew the page number and then where on the book. I could find it very easily. But if it&#8217;s just all the same, yeah, it&#8217;s kind of I need to&#8230; Maybe, can we have a background if something is color coded. Or can we have a shape or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s just a name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> So this is not part of Gutenberg, now I&#8217;m skipping again. So of course immediately after a major list, contributors are monitoring the support forms, and of course the Gutenberg tickets and the track tickets. One of the tickets that stood out a little bit, and I&#8217;m not going to talk about the underlying, is actually the page and post, the summary, or what used to be a summary panel. And this user was supporting that. They weren&#8217;t able to find the comment settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you look at the top of the panel now it&#8217;s links, so they&#8217;re not in separate panel anymore. And this person who just saw this for the first time probably, it wasn&#8217;t easy for them to find it. And that&#8217;s one of the changes in 6.6 that we actually haven&#8217;t discussed. Not in this call at least. People will get used to it. I don&#8217;t know if anything&#8217;s going to be moved back. I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, there was between&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if it was from one version to the next, but I know that there was a discussion about where should the revisions panels be? Should it be under the three point options kind of thing, or where should the sticky post thing be? And of course when you know, okay, that worked, that&#8217;s there now. And I can remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the first time, the shock, oh, did it go? Yeah, where did it go? You just want to get your work done and all of a sudden these hurdles come in with a new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> And the featured image also moved to the very top. It&#8217;s a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like that actually, because I&#8217;m always going to fear that I forget the featured image. A lot of designs are actually very visual and you have that in your post loop in the list of the block posts and there&#8217;s a featured image and you want to make sure that that&#8217;s in there. But yeah, it&#8217;s a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>That&#8217;s a good point. A good reminder to have it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But what I also like with the new workflow setting is that the number of words is right there. How many are in the post. That you only had to do three clicks to actually get to that? So in the outline tab of the list view, so you had to open up the list view, click to the outline, and then see how many words are in the post. Now you just go to the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>So I hope that you&#8217;re all keeping your blog post at least 3000 words now, right? For SEO purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And 15 blog posts make a book, right? 3000 words. Does that come from a search engine kind of quality content, needs to be 3000 words?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> It&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Only your most important content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Well, our writers on the developer blog, they&#8217;re always kind of bumping up on that number quite a bit. But that&#8217;s because we have some great code examples and explanations there and it&#8217;s always about our real world kind of example. And it takes that long to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, what else do we have in 18.8? We have a lot of changes in the component sections, but that&#8217;s so highly technical, about the custom select control version two. There&#8217;s a version two, dear developers. Those will be probably&#8230; If they come to a WordPress version they will be in a dev note, complete together, so you get them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they&#8217;re all smaller fixes that are in a bigger context. But now with the PRs it&#8217;s harder to describe what&#8217;s the bigger picture about it. So I would wait until they get into the WordPress major version where you try them out. For the block library, we have two things that we wanted to talk about. One is the aspect ratio control for image blocks in grids. That was something that was missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the hallway hangout, you saw it, that Isabel tried to get the picture into the grid and then it wouldn&#8217;t fill up the whole thing. And so now you can control the aspect ratio of those image blocks. It&#8217;s really cool. And then the other one is when I see reduced specificity, I first have a hard time pronouncing that word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Same. I also have difficulty even trying to spell it if I take it out. Yeah, reduce specificity of the social link icon color. I believe this is a bug fix. I guess the colors were either impacting something else or were impacted by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it wasn&#8217;t possible to control them. So now themes can control it. But yeah, CSS specificity was definitely a topic on the WordPress release in 6.6. And there were a few rumblings around, because for some features, theme developers fixed something that core didn&#8217;t do or needed to override. And now with 6.6, core fixed what they were doing, but then it affected what theme developers were doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they had to reduce certain things or revert some of the changes. But it also maybe was a little bit pushed too far with the underlined issue, the link underlined issue. And overall it was ripping off the bandaid to make section style possible, to reduce the specificity on certain CSS and have&#8230; It only affected a few theme developers that were very heavy on CSS, on style CSS still. So how did you find that change in 6.6 with your themes or you? Or in the discussion with the theme developers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> So I spent so many hours testing these changes early on, but not through the latest release candidates. So I obviously missed many, many things. I couldn&#8217;t keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nobody&#8217;s going to fault you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>With some of the changes. I have not had time to test my websites with 6.6 or my themes. I&#8217;m just going to wait a little and not just automated upgrade. I haven&#8217;t had time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s of course a good way to say, let other people find the faults. And I know that the core team is starting to work on a point release to come out somehow next week for 6.6.1 and you probably want to wait for that to update all the sites. So the release candidate is coming out I think tomorrow or today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> I think it&#8217;s today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s today. We are recording this on July 18th. So sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> That&#8217;s correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Just wanted to say what today is because it&#8217;s different for our listeners than it is for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> So today on Thursday the 18th, there are 10 fixes in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Okay. All right. And in two weeks we&#8217;re going to talk about it. So synced patterns got some updates as well. The one PR ensures to disable override buttons is active for image blocks with captions or links. Because you could override the image URL and the alt text, but you couldn&#8217;t change the captions or the link that the image went to. And that is now changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> The part of the bug was that if you already had the original image, had a caption, and the caption setting was only visible and you replaced the image, the caption did not update and you were not able to edit it. This sort of solves that in one way, but more work is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And that actually went into 6.6. And then the other bug fix for pattern overrides was to fix the aspect ratio with the image overrides. So it wouldn&#8217;t adhere to the aspect. When you uploaded a new image, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily adhere to the aspect ratio that was in the original before. So that is fixed too, and made it into 6.6. Yeah, was backboard to core, yes. All right. And then we had this disabled post, meta editing and blocks, that&#8217;s one of the inside query loops to finish my sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Yes. So this has to do with the synced patterns, the rights and the block bindings and it prevents bugs. Again, like with the query loop is&#8230; Again, it&#8217;s the loops. So everything you add to the inside, it&#8217;s going to be repeated and that&#8217;s why it should not be editable that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there was a feature there that if you needed to change post-meta for a certain block, you could do it in the query block, but that is now stopped. It&#8217;s disabled now. So there&#8217;s no confusion in overriding some. I think there were race conditions on the database for that. So that&#8217;s a good thing that it&#8217;s not on the query loop. If you want to change the metadata for a post, go to the post, do it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s one fix there that&#8217;s just for those who use the image block for plugins. And that is that the media ID and the block HML are supported for the block bindings. But that&#8217;s just&#8230; It&#8217;s really a technical update and a bug fix for 6.6. But it had quite a few discussions there and how that&#8217;s going to be fixed. But it is fixed now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there are quite a few experiments and we talked about that, that grid layouts or interactive grids is one experiment in the Gutenberg plugin. And there are two features, allow inserting blocks directly into the empty grid cells, wire drag and drop, and then also use the manual placement attribute to set manual grid mode and allow responsive behavior in both modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the grid layouts in 6.6, when you switch on the manual feature in the sidebar, it takes away&#8230; And you say, okay, I wanted three columns width in manual, then even your mobile version has three columns because that&#8217;s what you said in a manual grid. And now with them they allow&#8230; this is an experiment to allow certain manual grid attributes and make sure that it&#8217;s still a responsive behavior. So it&#8217;s kind of&#8230; Not quite sure if that is the right UI or the right approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go there and experiment with it to see if that satisfies. Because of course it&#8217;s surprising that if you put some manual in there, I want four columns and all of a sudden you see it in mobile and it is not responsive, that that disconnect is really hard to decipher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Nick Diego, who was the author of the 15 Ways to Curate The Editor Experience, found a gap in the documentation and he added how the rich text formatting or switching off rich text formatting features is done for the editor curation documentation. So that&#8217;s good. And then another documentation enhancement is that the interactivity API documentation now includes a few more examples and the reference for more examples in there. So if you are trying to get your head around the interactivity, API that might be even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just an announcement is CSS hacks, Internet Explorer 11 have been removed from the block editor from the Gutenberg plugin. And I don&#8217;t know how many, I think when we removed the Internet Explorer 11 support in general in WordPress, there was quite a big number of code line changes or removals. I don&#8217;t think this would amount to it. It&#8217;s probably most of the time an if than else hack. But it&#8217;s removed and it&#8217;s a clearer way to look at the CSS. All right, anything else you want to comment on for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Fixing documentation is always awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And sometimes there&#8217;s quite a few things that need to be fixed. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, so this concludes, dear listeners, our review of the Gutenberg Changelog for the Gutenberg 18.8 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are on the section now, what&#8217;s an active development and discussed. And I want to point out three things to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is a very smaller one and that is adding color and other style options to the audio block. That is a PR or an issue right now that&#8217;s discussed on how to manage that and what is the minimum viable product on that. Do we need a featured image? Do we not use a featured image on that? But chime in on that so the developer who will take that on has your input if you to it. Of course that&#8217;s a different story, but it&#8217;s definitely good to form opinions and to make them available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> And over time already, I guess I get a little bit excited talking about WordPress. So the audio element which is used in a block is almost impossible to style without either basically completely covering it with another element using CSS or with JavaScript. And it&#8217;s impossible to do it with just CSS. To add color options for everything around the actual audio element. Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting approach to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s definitely something. And it&#8217;s also a&#8230; There&#8217;s another element out there like the video elements or some of the embeds that also could use some additional style options. And I think working on the audio block gives everybody a feel how that can be approached and what would be needed there. So it&#8217;s also the iteration process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to share with the audience a link to an experiment on free form image cropping. The image cropper is quite difficult to get your head around. And the block editor as well as in the classic editor, there is no&#8230; Both are abysmally&#8230; So there is a PR that a developer is working on. And definitely it&#8217;s still in draft so it hasn&#8217;t been even merged or full review, but it&#8217;s definitely something you want to look at and maybe you can try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the biggest link that I wanted to share with you dear listener, is the updates for the media library. So the next step for the admin redesign is of course the posts, but that&#8217;s a small thing because the most things for the post everybody knows already. But the biggest one is how to rethink the media library with a new data admin. And Ramon Dodd started the process with a tracking issue and there is quite some discussion there. What else would be needed to change things or to bring over how it&#8217;s working now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s quite a discussion there that&#8217;s first interesting to see what everybody else is thinking, but also to chime in and figure out what is the first version going to look like when it comes to that media library in the new data admins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we are at the end of the show. Thank you so much Carolina, for being on the show and letting us all know about block themes and what&#8217;s in 6.6 and what&#8217;s coming and talking about the Gutenberg&#8217;s 18.8 plugin. Is there anything that you want to announce from Yoast or for what you are working on that you didn&#8217;t get to talk about? You get about two minutes or three now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: No, it&#8217;s okay. I work on Gutenberg when I find issues that are easy enough for me to work on. But that usually means that this looks easy and then four hours later you&#8217;re completely down a rabbit hole. I&#8217;m still trying to help out with the bundle teams triage, the bundle team task force and continue to find the problems, reporting new issues, and then we solve it together. So it&#8217;s working, mixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you so much for the great work on all of it, on what&#8217;s in WordPress and listeners, as always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

And I will do so again in a few months. So I hope to see you soon. I don&#8217;t know on any of the WordCamps, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re going to go to Rome to the Core days? Or what&#8217;s your next WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Undecided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Undecided. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Maybe Rome or maybe not until the next WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;m undecided too, so I&#8217;m kind of&#8230; We&#8217;ll see. Yeah. And if not, we see each other on the interwebs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark:</em> Oh, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>And take care.

Now you might think, well, building a company that’s trading bonds, what’s so aesthetic about that? But it is. What’s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Doing it right. Getting the right kind of people and approaching the problem and doing it right and if you feel like you feel like you’re the first one to do it right and I think we were, that’s a terrific feeling and it’s a beautiful thing to do something right. It’s also a beautiful thing to solve a math problem create some mathematics that people hadn’t thought of before, so “Be guided by beauty” is not such a bad principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s something I’d add, it’s that there is an art to imitation, copying the masters to further your own work. In jazz, we’d transcribe solos from great musicians, note for note, and try to recreate them perfectly, not because that was what we were going to do when we got on stage, but because that understanding and foundation gave us the mastery to take that work and build on top of it.
